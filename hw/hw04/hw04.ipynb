Archived 11/7/09\", u'Madison Square Garden': u'Madison Square Garden (sometimes called MSG or simply The Garden) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. Located between Seventh and Eighth Avenues from 31st to 33rd Streets, it is situated atop Pennsylvania Station (the second railroad station to bear the name). It is the fourth venue to bear the \"MSG\" name, the first two (1879 and 1890) of which were located on Madison Square, on East 26th Street and Madison Avenue, with the third Madison Square Garden further uptown at Eighth Avenue and 50th Street. The Garden is used for professional basketball and ice hockey, as well as boxing, concerts, ice shows, circuses, and other forms of sports and entertainment. It resides in close geographic proximity to other midtown Manhattan landmarks, including the Empire State Building, Koreatown, and Macy\\'s at Herald Square. It is home to the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League, the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association, and residency to singer-songwriter, Billy Joel.\\nOpening on February 11, 1968, it is now considered to be the oldest, and most active major sporting facility in the New York City metropolitan area. It is the oldest arena in the National Hockey League and the second-oldest arena in the National Basketball Association. Madison Square Garden is the third-busiest music arena in the world in terms of ticket sales, behind the Manchester Arena and The O2 Arena, both in England. At a total construction cost of approximately $1.1 billion, Madison Square Garden has been ranked as one of the ten most expensive stadium venues ever built. It is part of the Pennsylvania Plaza office and retail complex. Several other operating entities related to the Garden share its name.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Previous Gardens ===\\nThe original Madison Square, now a park, meets at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Broadway at 23rd Street in Manhattan. It was named after James Madison, fourth President of the United States.\\nMadison Square was the site of two venues called Madison Square Garden, the first from 1879 to 1890, and the second from 1890 to 1925. The first Garden, leased to P. T. Barnum, had no roof and was inconvenient to use during inclement weather, so it was demolished after 11 years. Madison Square Garden II was designed by noted architect Stanford White. The new building was built by a syndicate which included J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, P. T. Barnum, Darius Mills, James Stillman and W. W. Astor. White gave them a Beaux-Arts structure with a Moorish feel, including a minaret-like tower modeled after Giralda, the bell tower of the Cathedral of Seville \\u2013 soaring 32 stories \\u2013 the city\\'s second tallest building at the time \\u2013 dominating Madison Square Park. It was 200 feet (61 m) by 485 feet (148 m), and the main hall, which was the largest in the world, measured 200 feet (61 m) by 350 feet (110 m), with permanent seating for 8,000 people and floor space for thousands more. It had a 1200-seat theatre, a concert hall with a capacity of 1500, the largest restaurant in the city and a roof garden cabaret. The building cost $3 million. Madison Square Garden II was unsuccessful like the first Garden, and the New York Life Insurance Company, which held the mortgage on it, decided to tear it down in 1925 to make way for a new headquarters building, which would become the landmark Cass Gilbert-designed New York Life Building.\\nA third Madison Square Garden opened in a new location, on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, from 1925 to 1968. Groundbreaking on the third Madison Square Garden took place on January 9, 1925. Designed by the noted theater architect Thomas W. Lamb, it was built at the cost of $4.75 million in 249 days by boxing promoter Tex Rickard,; the arena was dubbed \"The House That Tex Built.\" The arena was 200 feet (61 m) by 375 feet (114 m), with seating on three levels, and a maximum capacity of 18,496 spectators for boxing. Demolition commenced in 1968 after the opening of the current Garden. It finished up in early 1969, and the site is now where One Worldwide Plaza is located.\\n\\n\\n=== Current Garden ===\\nOn February 11, 1968, the current Madison Square Garden (sometimes referred to as Madison Square Garden IV) opened after the Pennsylvania Railroad tore down the above-ground portions of the original Pennsylvania Station. The new structure was one of the first of its kind to be built above the platforms of an active railroad station. It was an engineering feat constructed by Robert E. McKee of El Paso, Texas. Public outcry over the demolition of Pennsylvania Station structure\\u2014an outstanding example of Beaux-Arts architecture\\u2014led to the creation of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The Garden is located in the office and entertainment complex formally addressed as Pennsylvania Plaza and commonly known as Penn Plaza, named for the railroad station.\\n\\nIn 1972, the Garden\\'s chairman, Irving Mitchell Felt, proposed moving the New York Knicks and Rangers to a then incomplete venue in the New Jersey Meadowlands: the Meadowlands Sports Complex. The Garden was also the home arena for the NY Raiders/NY Golden Blades of the World Hockey Association. The Meadowlands would eventually host its own NBA and NHL teams (the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils, respectively). The NFL\\'s New York Giants and Jets also relocated there. Felt\\'s efforts fueled controversy between the Garden and New York City over real estate taxes. The disagreement again flared in 1980 when the Garden again challenged its tax bill.\\nIn 1991, Garden owners spent $200 million to renovate facilities and add 89 suites in place of hundreds of upper-tier seats. The project was designed by Ellerbe Becket. In 2004\\u20132005, Cablevision battled with the City of New York over the proposed West Side Stadium, which was cancelled. Cablevision then announced plans to raze the Garden, replace it with high-rise commercial buildings, and build a new Garden one block away at the site of the James Farley Post Office. Meanwhile a new project to renovate and modernize the Garden completed phase one in time for the Rangers and Knicks\\' 2011\\u201312 seasons, though the vice president of the Garden says he remains committed to the installation of an extension of Penn Station at the Farley Post Office site. While the Knicks and Rangers will not be displaced, the New York Liberty will play at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey during the renovation.\\n\\n\\n=== 2011\\u20132013 renovation ===\\n\\nMadison Square Garden\\'s $1 billion second renovation took place mainly over three offseasons. It was set to begin after the 2009\\u201310 hockey/basketball seasons, but was delayed until after the 2010\\u201311 seasons. Renovation was done in phases with the majority of the work done in the summer months to minimize disruptions to the NHL and NBA seasons. While the Rangers and Knicks were not displaced, the Liberty played their home games through the 2013 season at Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey during the renovation.\\nNew features include a larger entrance with interactive kiosks, retail, climate controlled space, and broadcast studio; larger concourses; new lighting and LED video systems with HDTV; new seating; two new pedestrian walkways suspended from the ceiling to allow fans to look directly down onto the games being played below; more dining options; and improved dressing rooms, locker rooms, green rooms, upgraded roof, and production offices. The in-arena walkways were eliminated, and portals have been installed between the sections. The lower bowl concourse, called the Madison Concourse, remains on the 6th floor. The upper bowl concourse was relocated to the 8th floor and it is known as the Garden Concourse. The seventh floor houses the new Madison Suites and the Madison Club. The upper bowl was built on top of these suites. The Loge 100 and 200 level were combined to create the new lower bowl. The 300 and 400 level were combined to create the new upper bowl. The periphery of the arena allows for city views.\\nConstruction of the lower bowl (Phase One) was completed for the 2011\\u20132012 NHL season and the 2011-12 NBA lockout shortened season. An extended off-season for the Garden permitted some advanced work to begin on the new upper bowl, which was completed in time for the 2012\\u20132013 NBA season and the 2012\\u201313 NHL lockout-shortened NHL season. This advance work included the West Balcony on the 10th floor, taking the place of sky-boxes, and new end-ice 300 level seating. The construction of the upper bowl along with the Madison Suites and the Madison Club (Phase Two) were completed for the 2012\\u20132013 NHL and NBA seasons. The construction of the new lobby known as Chase Square, along with the Chase Bridges and the new scoreboard (Phase Three) were completed for the 2013\\u20132014 NHL and NBA seasons.\\n\\n\\n=== Penn Station renovation controversy ===\\nMadison Square Garden is seen as an obstacle in the renovation and future expansion of Penn Station, which is already expanding through the James Farley Post Office, and some have proposed moving MSG to other sites in western Manhattan. On February 15, 2013, Manhattan Community Board 5 voted 36 to 0 against granting a renewal to MSG\\'s operating permit in perpetuity and proposed a 10-year limit instead in order to build a new Penn Station where the arena is currently standing. Manhattan borough president Scott Stringer said, \"Moving the arena is an important first step to improving Penn Station.\" The Madison Square Garden Company responded by saying that \"[i]t is incongruous to think that M.S.G. would be considering moving.\"\\nIn May 2013, four architecture firms \\u2013 SHoP Architects, SOM, H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture, and Diller Scofidio + Renfro \\u2013 submitted proposals for a new Penn Station. SHoP Architects recommended moving Madison Square Garden to the Morgan Postal Facility a few blocks southwest, as well as removing 2 Penn Plaza and redeveloping other towers, and an extension of the High Line to Penn Station. Meanwhile, SOM proposed moving Madison Square Garden to the area just south of the James Farley Post Office, and redeveloping the area above Penn Station as a mixed-use development with commercial, residential, and recreational space. H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture wanted to move the arena to a new pier west of Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, four blocks west of the current station/arena. Then, according to H3\\'s plan, four skyscrapers at each of the four corners of the new Penn Station superblock, with a roof garden on top of the station; the Farley Post Office would become an education center. Finally, Diller Scofidio + Renfro proposed a mixed-use development on the site, with spas, theaters, a cascading park, a pool, and restaurants; Madison Square Garden would be moved two blocks west, next to the post office. DS+F also proposed high-tech features in the station, such as train arrival and departure boards on the floor, and applications that can help waiting passengers peruse their time until they board their trains. Madison Square Garden rejected the allegations that it would be relocated, and called the plans \"pie-in-the-sky\".\\nIn June 2013, the New York City Council Committee on Land Use voted unanimously to give the Garden a ten year permit, at the end of which period the owners will either have to relocate, or go back through the permission process. On July 24, the City Council voted to give the Garden a ten year operating permit by a vote of 47 to 1. \"This is the first step in finding a new home for Madison Square Garden and building a new Penn Station that is as great as New York and suitable for the 21st century,\" said City Council speaker Christine Quinn. \"This is an opportunity to reimagine and redevelop Penn Station as a world-class transportation destination.\"\\nIn October 2014, the Morgan facility was selected as the most ideal area for Madison Square Garden to be moved, following the 2014 MAS Summit in New York City. More plans for the station were discussed.\\n\\n\\n== Events ==\\n\\n\\n=== Regular events ===\\n\\n\\n==== Sports ====\\nMadison Square Garden hosts approximately 320 events a year. It is the home to the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League, the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association, and the New York Liberty of the Women\\'s National Basketball Association. The New York Rangers, New York Knicks, New York Liberty, and the Madison Square Garden arena itself are all owned by Madison Square Garden, L.P. The arena is also host to the Big East Men\\'s Basketball Conference Tournament and the finals of the National Invitation Tournament. Other regular events at the arena include the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus when it comes to New York City (although the Izod Center and Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum also host the circus each year), selected home games for the St. John\\'s men\\'s Red Storm (college basketball), the annual pre- and postseason NIT tournaments, the NBA Draft, the Millrose Games track and field meet, and almost any other kind of indoor activity that draws large audiences, such as the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and the 2004 Republican National Convention.\\n\\n\\n==== Concerts ====\\n\\nMany large music concerts in New York City take place in Madison Square Garden. Particularly famous ones include George Harrison\\'s The Concert for Bangladesh, The Concert for New York City following the September 11 attacks, John Lennon\\'s final concert appearance (during an Elton John concert on Thanksgiving Night, 1974) before his murder in 1980, and Elvis Presley, who gave four sold out performances in 1972, his first and last ever in New York City. A 1971 rock-and-roll revival concert at the Garden, featuring Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry and Ricky Nelson, during which Nelson was reportedly booed when he played newer material, is thought to have been the inspiration for his 1972 hit single \"Garden Party\". The Garden usually hosts a concert each New Year\\'s Eve, while the Knicks and Rangers play on the road. The Police played their final show of their reunion tour at the Garden in 2008.\\nElton John holds the all-time record for greatest number of appearances at the Garden with 64 shows (the 60th occurring on his 60th birthday, March 25, 2007), and Billy Joel set a record in 2006 during his 12-performance run, the longest run of a single artist at the venue.

The first level, which was available only for basketball games and concerts, but not for hockey games and ice shows, as the \"floor\" or \"court-side\" seating. Next above this was the loge (red) seating, followed by the 100-level (orange) and 200-level (yellow) promenades, the 300-level (green) promenade, and the 400-level (blue) or mezzanine. The rainbow colored seats were replaced with maroon and teal seats during the 1990s renovation which installed the 10th floor sky-boxes around the entire arena and the 9th floor sky-boxes on the 7th avenue end of the arena, taking out 400-level seating on the 7th Avenue end in the process.\\n\\nBecause all of the seats, except the 400 level, were in one monolithic grandstand, horizontal distance from the arena floor was significant from the ends of the arena. Also, the rows rose much more gradually than other North American arenas, which caused impaired sight lines, especially when sitting behind tall spectators or one of the concourses. This arrangement, however, created an advantage over newer arenas in that seats had a significantly lower vertical distance from the arena floor.\\nAs part of the 2011\\u20132013 renovation, the club sections, 100-level and 200-level have been combined to make a new 100-level lower bowl. The 300-level and 400-level were combined and raised 17 feet closer, forming a new 200-level upper bowl. All skyboxes but those on the 7th Avenue end were removed and replaced with balcony seating (8th Avenue) and Chase Bridge Seating (31st Street and 33rd Street). The sky-boxes on the 9th floor were remodeled and are now called the Signature Suites. The sky-boxes on the 7th Avenue end of the 10th Floor are now known as the Lounges. One small section of the 400-level remains near the west end of the arena, and features blue seats. The media booths have been relocated to the 31st Street Chase Bridge.\\n\\n\\n=== Capacity ===\\nThe capacity for basketball has been as follows:\\n19,500 (1968\\u20131971)\\n19,588 (1971\\u20131972)\\n19,693 (1972\\u20131978)\\n19,591 (1978\\u20131989)\\n18,212 (1989\\u20131990)\\n19,081 (1990\\u20131991)\\n19,763 (1991\\u20132012)\\n19,033 (2012\\u20132013)\\n19,812 (2013\\u2013present)\\nThe capacity for hockey has been as follows:\\n17,250 (1968\\u20131972)\\n17,500 (1972\\u20131990)\\n16,792 (1990\\u20131991)\\n18,200 (1991\\u20132012)\\n17,200 (2012\\u20132013)\\n18,006 (2013\\u2013present)\\n\\n\\n=== The Theater at Madison Square Garden ===\\n\\nThe Theater at Madison Square Garden seats between 2,000 and 5,600 for concerts and can also be used for meetings, stage shows, and graduation ceremonies. It was the home of the NFL Draft until 2005, when it moved to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center after MSG management opposed a new stadium for the New York Jets. It also hosted the NBA Draft from 2001 to 2010. The theater also occasionally hosts boxing matches on nights when the main arena is unavailable. The fall 1999 Jeopardy!

He helped them to secure a record deal, produced their first album, Buckingham Nicks, and let them live in his house, even employing Nicks as a housekeeper for a while. After introducing them to Mick Fleetwood, he went on to produce Fleetwood Mac\\'s eponymous 1975 album, which reached No. 1 in the US.\\nThrough the 70s, 80s, and 90s, Olsen built a legendary reputation as a producer. To date his production work has earned him more than 39 Gold, 24 Platinum, and 14 Multi-Platinum album certifications. Olsen has been front line producer on over 100 complete albums. In addition to Fleetwood Mac, some of the artists he has worked with include the Grateful Dead (he produced and engineered their 1977 album Terrapin Station), Bob Weir, Eddie Money, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Rick Springfield (he produced Springfield\\'s No. 1 hit \"Jessie\\'s Girl\"), REO Speedwagon, Pat Benatar, Heart, Joe Walsh, Starship, Santana, Kim Carnes, Jethro Tull, The Babys, Ozzy Osbourne (No Rest for the Wicked), Scorpions, Bad Company, Europe (band), 38 Special, Russ Ballard, Sammy Hagar, Whitesnake, Foreigner, Sheena Easton, Steve Perry, Journey, Loverboy, and Lou Gramm. He\\'s also been involved in several movie soundtracks, including Footloose, Vision Quest, Tron, Flashdance and Top Gun.\\nIn 1996, Olsen stepped back a little from artist production to concentrate on developing surround sound music mixes for the Kore Group record label, licensing existing masters, remixing them for surround sound, and re-releasing them. As corporate director of global product development at Mackie Designs, he assembled a team of experts to develop their digital products line.\\nOlsen currently produces several albums per year for Pogologo Productions Group and is a member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) Producers and Engineers Wing, the mission of which he strongly believes is necessary in this era of digital revolution. He currently serves on the A&N Committee, the P&E Steering Committee and the P&E Advisory Council.\\n\\n\\n== References ==', u'Associated British Corporation': u\"Associated British Corporation (otherwise known as ABC Television Britain) was one of a number of commercial television companies established in the United Kingdom during the 1950s by cinema chain companies in an attempt to safeguard their business by becoming involved with television which was taking away their cinema audiences. In this case, the parent company was the Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC), which initially did not wish to become involved with the new broadcasting system, but were persuaded to do so by the Independent Television Authority (ITA) and the manager of their Path\\xe9 News subsidiary Howard Thomas, who became the new company's managing director.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nWhen Kemsley-Winnick, one of the consortia that had been awarded a franchise in the new Independent Television network in 1954 collapsed, the ITA approached ABPC to step into the breach. Accordingly, the Corporation agreed to assume the franchises to broadcast on Saturdays and Sundays to the Midlands and the North of England. The contract agreeing to do so was signed on 21 September 1955, the day before Independent Television (ITV) began in London.\\nThis gave the new ABC five months to begin broadcasting in the Midlands, the service beginning on 18 February 1956. Soon afterwards, they were also up and running in the North - they began broadcasting there for the first time on 5 May 1956. They were aided in part by the failure of the original contractor; Kelmsley-Winnick had ordered over \\xa31 million (equivalent to \\xa322.9 million today) of production equipment from manufacturer Pye which they sold to ABC at a much discounted price.\\n\\n\\n=== The 1968 Contract Round ===\\nStructural changes in the regional contract areas meant that ABC no longer had a contract to re-apply for. The Northern area (renamed Lancashire) became a seven-day operation as did the Midlands. Existing weekday contractors (Granada and ATV respectively) were correctly considered the favourites. ABC consequently submitted two applications: one for the service for London at the weekend, the other for the Midlands seven-day operation although they favoured the first contract.\\nIt was expected that ABC would be awarded the weekend London licence, but the strength of another application (from the London Weekend Television Consortium) ruled this out. This led to a situation where a successful company could be closed down through no fault of its own. To prevent this, the governing body of ITV, the Independent Television Authority, ordered a merger with the existing London weekday company Rediffusion, with ABC having majority control of the new operation.\\nDespite protests from Rediffusion, the two companies eventually became Thames Television. ABC ceased weekend broadcasting in the North and Midlands regions on 22 July 1968, and resumed on 30 July in the London region as weekday company Thames.\\n\\n\\n== Studios ==\\n\\nABC operated three production sites and had a further sales office. The main production facilities were the former Warner Studios located at Teddington, Middlesex. Although outside of their contract area, ABC operated a London base as many celebrities couldn't venture outside of the capital to record programmes as they were often starring in theatre plays in the West End. Upon the merger with Rediffusion this site became the main production base for the new company Thames Television and is still in use as an independent facility, Teddington Studios.\\nABC operated a northern studio centre, converted from a former Capitol cinema in Didsbury, Manchester and a sales office based in Television House in the centre of the city. Following the merger the studios were leased to Yorkshire Television in 1967 for recording pre-launch programming whilst their own studios were being constructed and in 1970 was sold to Manchester Polytechic and was the base for their theatre and television school. After moving to the University's All Saints campus, the site was demolished in 1996 to make way for blocks of flats.\\nIn the Midlands they formed a joint venture with Midlands weekday licensee ATV to oversee the running of a production and transmission facility to be used by both. Alpha Television purchased a former cinema in Aston, near Birmingham and extended it by the construction of additional studios and office space; the site was known as the Alpha Studios.\\nDuring 1968 ABC vacated the premises as a result of its move to London. Faced with high costs for converting the studios to colour production ATV opted to build new studios in the heart of Birmingham, subsequently named Alpha Tower. During 1970 they also left the site and Alpha Television went into voluntary liquidation and the site sold. In 1974 the commercial Independent Local Radio station BRMB bought the centre and converted it into a radio station, remaining there until the late 1990s. The original cinema has since been demolished but the additional office space still remains.\\n\\n\\n== Identity ==\\nWhen ABC first went on the air, they utilised the successful branding of their sister company ABC Cinemas. This featured a triangular shield with the letters ABC upon it, and a bar across it with the caption 'Television'. This lasted from the stations launch in 1956 until c.1958. The ITA had criticised ABC's original presentation style for being bland and too much attached to the existing ABC Cinemas brand.\\nAs a result, ABC created a new brand ident featuring three arrows pointing to the bottom of the screen to reveal the letters ABC in turn and leaving a triangle behind and on top of the letters. At the end of this, the three triangles would snap together into the new ABC logo. This ident lasted until 1964 when the lettering font was altered slightly from a serif font to the latest bold used by the company, with the latest revision used until the company's end.\\nThe logo uses the notion of threes, three triangles making another triangle, with the points of a triangle often being labelled 'A', 'B' and 'C' in geometry. The tune that was used for all of ABC's idents was a vibraphone playing 'la-te-doh' (or a tonic triad of 'A-B-C'). Out of this look, ABC Television developed a strong corporate identity, effectively becoming the first British TV station to recognise the importance of corporate brandingTemplate:Fact-inline.\\nThe company itself was called Associated British Cinemas (Television) Limited, however on exports and some continuing productions for Thames Television, the name Associated British Corporation was used. As for on-air, the name was for a few months Associated British, before becoming ABC Television. The station also received a joke nickname from Bob Monkhouse, namely All Bloody Commercials.\\nThe stations slogan varied through time, starting off as ABC - Associated British Corporation in the North/Midlands before being replaced in 1958 to ABC, your weekend television and again changed in 1964 to ABC, your weekend television in the North/Midlands.\\n\\n\\n== Programming ==\\nNetworked programmes from ABC included the drama series Police Surgeon, The Human Jungle, Redcap, The Avengers, the Armchair Theatre series of single plays, the Habatales cartoons, the popular shows Thank Your Lucky Stars and Oh Boy!, the children's science fiction serial Emerald Soup, plus the gritty dramas Callan and Public Eye (both of which continued as Thames productions after 1968), Target Luna and its sequels: Pathfinders in Space, Pathfinders to Mars, and Pathfinders to Venus.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nAssociated Television\\nGranada Television\\nAssociated Rediffusion\\nITV (TV network)\\nHistory of ITV\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nABC at Large from Telemusications (unofficial history site)\\nAnimated ABC logo, 1960s from 625.uk.com (Macromedia Flash 6 or later required)\\nAnimated ABC logo, c.1964 from 625.uk.com.\", u'BMT Broadway Line': u'The BMT Broadway Line is a rapid transit line of the B Division of the New York City Subway in Manhattan, New York City, United States. As of 2010, it is served by three services, all colored sunflower yellow: the Q on the express tracks and the N Q R on the local tracks. The line is often referred to as the \"N and R\", since those were the only services on the line during the long years that the Manhattan Bridge south tracks were closed for rebuilding. The Broadway Line was built to give the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (later the Brooklyn\\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation) access to Midtown Manhattan.\\nThe line is named for its location under Broadway between Vesey Street and Seventh Avenue (Times Square). It also passes under Vesey Street, Whitehall Street, Trinity Place, and Church Street in Lower Manhattan, and Seventh Avenue, 59th Street, and 60th Street in Midtown. The local tracks stretch the entire length between the two East River tunnels: the Montague Street Tunnel to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn and the 60th Street Tunnel to the BMT Astoria Line and 60th Street Tunnel Connection in Queens. Center express tracks exist between Canal Street and 57th Street, turning off at Canal Street to feed the south tracks on the Manhattan Bridge, and continuing north and east under Central Park as the BMT 63rd Street Line (presently unused, but planned to connect with the Second Avenue Subway). The Broadway Line was the only Manhattan outlet north of Delancey Street for the BMT\\'s Brooklyn lines until 1967, when most BMT Brighton Line and BMT West End Line trains were moved to the IND Sixth Avenue Line via the new Chrystie Street Connection.\\n\\n\\n== Extent and service ==\\nServices that use the Broadway Line are colored sunflower yellow.\\nThe BMT Broadway Line begins at the 60th Street Tunnel from Queens. It runs west as a two-track subway line under 60th Street (east of Fifth Avenue) and 59th Street (west of Fifth Avenue), with stations at Lexington Avenue / 59th Street and Fifth Avenue / 59th Street. It then turns south to Seventh Avenue into the local tracks at 57th Street \\u2013 Seventh Avenue. This segment of the line carries the N Q services from the BMT Astoria Line and the R service from the IND Queens Boulevard Line.\\nAt the 57th Street station, the line joins two express tracks that enter the station from the north via the BMT 63rd Street Line. There is no scheduled BMT service on the 63rd Street Line at present. The BMT 63rd Street Line will carry the Q service across 63rd Street and up the proposed Second Avenue Line. The express tracks at 57th Street are currently used as terminal tracks for the Q train on late nights and weekends.\\nThe BMT Broadway Line proceeds as a four-track subway down Seventh Avenue to its intersection with Broadway, and then continues down Broadway to a point north of Canal Street, where the express tracks carrying the N Q services descend and turn sharply east into the Canal Street (formerly Broadway) station of the BMT Broadway \\u2013 Manhattan Bridge Line.\\nImmediately after Canal Street, the express tracks resume again (originally they had been intended to run through) and serve as storage and turning tracks, bypassing the Canal Street local station and ending in the disused lower level of City Hall. The local tracks continue south as a two-track subway to Whitehall Street \\u2013 South Ferry station. Whitehall Street \\u2013 South Ferry is a three track, two-platform station, with the center track set up as a terminal track, formerly used as the south terminal for now defunct W service. Now, the center track is currently only used during service disruptions. A pair of bellmouths exists here, allowing for a connection to a never-built East River tunnel south of the Montague Street Tunnel. It has been proposed to use this as part of the Lower Manhattan \\u2013 Jamaica/JFK Transportation Project, connecting to the Court Street station (New York Transit Museum) in Brooklyn.\\nThe BMT Broadway Line then curves east carrying the N R trains to a trailing junction with the BMT Nassau Street Line (no regular service trains) and enters the Montague Street Tunnel to Brooklyn.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe New York Public Service Commission adopted plans for what was known as the Broadway\\u2013Lexington Avenue route on December 31, 1907. This route began at the Battery and ran under Greenwich Street, Vesey Street, Broadway to Ninth Street, private property to Irving Place, and Irving Place and Lexington Avenue to the Harlem River. After crossing under the Harlem River into the Bronx, the route split at Park Avenue and 138th Street, with one branch continuing north to and along Jerome Avenue to Woodlawn Cemetery, and the other heading east and northeast along 138th Street, Southern Boulevard, and Westchester Avenue to Pelham Bay Park. In early 1908, the Tri-borough plan was formed, combining this route, the under-construction Centre Street Loop Subway in Manhattan and Fourth Avenue Subway in Brooklyn, a Canal Street Subway from the Fourth Avenue Subway via the Manhattan Bridge to the Hudson River, and several other lines in Brooklyn.\\n\\nThe Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company submitted a proposal to the Commission, dated March 2, 1911, to operate the Tri-borough system (but under Church Street instead of Greenwich Street), as well as a branch along Broadway, Seventh Avenue, and 59th Street from Ninth Street north and east to the Queensboro Bridge; the Canal Street Subway was to merge with the Broadway Line instead of continuing to the Hudson River. The city, the BRT, and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (which operated the first subway and four elevated lines in Manhattan) came to an agreement, and sent a report to the Board of Estimate on June 5, 1911. The line along Broadway to 59th Street was assigned to the BRT, while the IRT obtained the Lexington Avenue line, connecting with its existing route at Grand Central \\u2013 42nd Street. Construction began on Lexington Avenue on July 31, and on Broadway the next year. The Dual Contracts, two operating contracts between the city and the BMT and IRT, were adopted on March 4, 1913.\\nBecause of the complicated history, the Broadway Line includes several remnants of earlier plans. The line was built as four tracks south to City Hall, where the local tracks were to end at the upper level, and the express tracks were to use the lower level, curving through Vesey Street into Church Street. However, the final plan had the express tracks splitting at Canal Street and passing under the northbound local track to the Manhattan Bridge. The tunnel south of City Hall was rebuilt to bring the upper local tracks down to the lower level north of Vesey Street, and the lower level at City Hall was never used for passenger service.\\nUnused construction is also present near the west end of the Queensboro Bridge. The original plan there was to build two one-track tunnels under 59th and 60th Streets, rising onto the bridge to Queens. However, plans were changed in 1915 to place both tracks under 60th Street and cross the East River in the 60th Street Tunnel, in part due to heavy vehicular traffic over the bridge. A piece of the 59th Street tunnel had already been built, concurrent with the construction of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and became a walkway connecting the two side platforms of the IRT\\'s 59th Street station.\\nAnother unused provision existed for many years north of 57th Street, where the two express tracks ended before being connected to the BMT 63rd Street Line in 1989. Plans were made, but never carried through, to build a line northwest through Central Park and under Eighth Avenue through the Upper West Side to Inwood, along the route later built as the IND Eighth Avenue Line.\\nA short portion of the line, coming off the north side of the Manhattan Bridge through Canal Street to 14th Street \\u2013 Union Square, opened on September 4, 1917. An extension north to Times Square \\u2013 42nd Street and south to Rector Street was completed on January 5, 1918. Further portions were opened south to Whitehall Street \\u2013 South Ferry on September 20, 1918, north to 57th Street on July 10, 1919, and east to Lexington Avenue / 59th Street on September 1, 1919. Both East River tunnels - the 60th Street Tunnel to Queensboro Plaza and the Montague Street Tunnel to DeKalb Avenue - opened on August 1, 1920, completing the Broadway Line.\\n\\n\\n=== Service history ===\\nAt most times, the Broadway Line has had four services \\u2014 two local and two express \\u2014 during the day, with a third express service until the 1967 opening of the Chrystie Street Connection.\\n1/QT (BMT Brighton Line) local trains ran until 1967, when the QT was discontinued. At that time, the EE was introduced, becoming part of the N in 1976; the N became express and the W became local in 2004.\\n1/Q (BMT Brighton Line) express trains were mostly moved to the IND Sixth Avenue Line as a relocated D in 1967, but a few trips stayed as the QB, later the Q again. During the Manhattan Bridge reconstruction, from the 1980s until 2001, the Q mostly used the IND Sixth Avenue Line. When restored in 2001, the Q became full-time, replacing the D on the Brighton Line.\\n2/RR (BMT Fourth Avenue Line) trains (later R) have run local over the Broadway Line since 1920.\\n3/T (BMT West End Line) trains ran express on the Broadway Line until 1967, when the T became part of the realigned B via the IND Sixth Avenue Line.\\n4/N (BMT Sea Beach Line) trains used the express tracks until the Manhattan Bridge reconstruction in the 1980s, when all N trips became local. (Some had run local since the EE was merged into the N in 1976.) When the Manhattan Bridge south tracks reopened in 2001, the W was introduced, at first running express; it became local in 2004, and the N moved back to the express tracks.\\nSeveral other services have used the express tracks, including the NX (Sea Beach, 1967\\u20131968) and the B (West End) and D (Brighton) during closures of the Manhattan Bridge north tracks in the 1980s and 1990s.\\nOn June 28, 2010, the N began running local north of Canal Street at all times and the Q train was extended to/from Astoria, Queens via the 60th Street Tunnel in place of the W service (which was discontinued after June 25, 2010 due to MTA budget problems) on weekdays, and began stopping on the local tracks starting at Times Square \\u2013 42nd Street.\\nIn December 2014, the Q began running local on the line between Canal Street and 57th Street \\u2013 Seventh Avenue during late nights.\\nThe current set of three services \\u2014 N Q R trains \\u2014 have used the line since July 22, 2001, when the south tracks on the Manhattan Bridge reopened. Until February 22, 2004, when the north tracks reopened, however, the N was local and the now defunct W was express.\\n\\n\\n== Station listing ==\\n*49th Street is accessible northbound only\\n\\n\\n== References ==', u'Tom Paciorek': u'Thomas Marian Paciorek (/p\\u0259\\u02c8t\\u0283\\u0254r\\u025bk/ p\\u01dd-CHOR-ek; born November 2, 1946 in Detroit, Michigan) attended Pershing High School, also in Detroit and is a former outfielder/first baseman who spent 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Los Angeles Dodgers (1970\\u20131975), Atlanta Braves (1976\\u20131978), Seattle Mariners (1978\\u20131981), Chicago White Sox (1982\\u20131985), New York Mets (1985) and Texas Rangers (1986\\u20131987). He appeared twice in the postseason, with the National League (NL) Champion Dodgers in 1974 and the American League (AL) West-winning White Sox in 1983.\\nFollowing his retirement as an active player, he worked as a color commentator for various MLB clubs, most notably the White Sox where he was teamed with Ken Harrelson on telecasts throughout the 1990s. Paciorek is famously known by the nickname Wimpy which was given to him by Tom Lasorda after a dinner with minor league teammates in which he was the only one to order a hamburger instead of steak.\\n\\n\\n== Collegiate career ==\\nPaciorek played baseball and football for the University of Houston from 1965 to 1968. A defensive back, he was picked by the Miami Dolphins in the ninth round of the 1968 NFL Draft. As a part of the Houston Cougars baseball club, he was named to the All-Tournament team after the Cougars became the national runner-up in the 1967 College World Series. Paciorek\\'s number was retired by the Cougars as one of only three in the history of the team.\\n\\n\\n== Major league career ==\\nHe was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1968, one of 14 players drafted by the Dodgers that year to reach the majors. A top prospect, he was The Sporting News\\' Minor League Player of the Year in 1972. He spent the 1973 through 1975 seasons as a fourth outfielder and pinch hitter. After hitting under .200 in 1975, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves as part of a trade for Dusty Baker. He hit .290 in a platoon role for Atlanta in 1976 but he struggled to duplicate those numbers the following year.\\nThe Braves released him after spring training in 1978, but signed him again just a week later. However, six weeks and only nine at bats later, the Braves gave him his release a second time. Paciorek then signed with the Seattle Mariners, where he finished the season hitting .299.\\nFollowing two solid years as a platoon player, Paciorek put together a career season with the Mariners in the 1981 season. Playing full-time for the only time in his career, Paciorek batted .326, second in the American League, and was fourth in the AL in slugging percentage. He earned his only appearance to an All-Star team in 1981 and was 10th in the AL MVP race.\\nIn the offseason, the Mariners traded Paciorek to the Chicago White Sox for three players, none of whom would make an impact with Seattle. Paciorek hit over .300 his first two years with the Sox, and was part of Chicago\\'s division championship team in 1983.\\nWith the White Sox in 1984, he set an unusual MLB record. Paciorek replaced Ron Kittle in left field in the fourth inning of a May 8 game with the Milwaukee Brewers \\u2013 a game which then proceeded to last 25 innings, becoming the longest game in Major League history (as measured in time on the field). By the time the game ended the following day, Paciorek had amassed five hits in nine at bats, a record for most hits in a game by a player that did not start the game which still stands. Several players have had four hits in a game as a substitute, most recently Quinton McCracken of the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2002.\\nHe was traded to the New York Mets in 1985, then spent his final two years with the Texas Rangers.\\nTom was one of three brothers to play in the Majors. His younger brother Jim played for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1987, while older brother John played one game for the Houston Colt .45\\'s (in which he went 3\\u20133 and walked twice) in 1963.\\n\\n\\n== After baseball ==\\nPaciorek has served as a broadcaster for several years since retiring as a player, with his most notable stint as the color commentator on White Sox television broadcasts alongside Ken Harrelson, who affectionately called him by his baseball nickname, \"Wimpy\", on-air. Paciorek broadcast for the White Sox from 1988 to 1999, then called selected games for the Detroit Tigers in 2000 and the Seattle Mariners in 2001 before calling the Atlanta Braves on FSN South from 2002 to 2005. In 2006, he was the color commentator for the Washington Nationals, but his contract was not renewed for 2007. He is fondly remembered amongst Nationals fans for his distinct pronunciation of \"Alfonso Soriano,\" a Nationals outfielder that season: \"Eelfahnso Soriaahno\".\\nIn 1992, Tom Paciorek was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.\\nIn the spring of 2002, Paciorek told the Detroit Free Press in a report that priest Gerald Shirilla had molested him and three of his four brothers while working as a teacher at St. Ladislaus Catholic High School in Hamtramck in the 1960s. \"I was molested by him for a period of four years,\" Paciorek is reported to have said. \"I would refer to them as attacks. I would say there was at least a hundred of them.\" The former All-Star said he didn\\'t tell anyone because no one would have believed him. \"When you\\'re a kid, and you\\'re not able to articulate, who\\'s going to believe you?\" he asked. \"The church back then was so powerful, there\\'s nothing that a kid could do\".\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of Washington Nationals broadcasters\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nCareer statistics and player information from Baseball-Reference, or Fangraphs, or The Baseball Cube, or Baseball-Reference (Minors)', u'Gaylord Perry': u'Gaylord Jackson Perry (born September 15, 1938) is a former Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher. He pitched from 1962 to 1983 for eight different teams. During a 22-year baseball career, Perry compiled 314 wins, 3,534 strikeouts, and a 3.11 earned run average. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991.\\nPerry, a five-time All-Star, was the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in each league, winning it in the American League in 1972 with the Cleveland Indians and in the National League in 1978 with the San Diego Padres. He is also distinguished, along with his brother Jim, for being the second-winningest brother combination in baseball history\\u2014second only to the knuckleballing Niekro brothers, Phil and Joe. While pitching for the Seattle Mariners in 1982, Perry became the fifteenth member of the 300 win club.\\nDespite Perry\\'s notoriety for doctoring baseballs (e.g. throwing a spitball), and perhaps even more so for making batters think he was throwing them on a regular basis \\u2013 he even went so far as to title his 1974 autobiography Me and the Spitter \\u2013 he was not ejected for the illegal practice until August 23, 1982, in his 21st season in the majors.\\nLike most pitchers, Perry was not renowned for his hitting ability, and in his sophomore season of 1963, his manager Alvin Dark is said to have joked, \"They\\'ll put a man on the moon before he hits a home run.\" There are other variants on the story, but either way, on July 20, 1969, just an hour after the Apollo 11 spacecraft carrying Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon, Perry hit the first home run of his career.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nGaylord Perry was born in Williamston, North Carolina, and named after a close friend of his father\\'s, who died while having his teeth pulled. He studied at Campbell University in his home state.\\n\\n\\n== Pitching style ==\\nPerry claims he was taught the spitball in 1964 by pitcher Bob Shaw. Perry had a reputation throughout his career for doctoring baseballs, and was inspected on the mound by umpires and monitored closely by opposing teams. On August 23, 1982, he was ejected from a game against the Boston Red Sox for doctoring the ball, and given a 10-day suspension.\\nPerry reportedly approached the makers of Vaseline about endorsing the product and was allegedly rebuffed with a one-line postcard reading, \"We soothe babies\\' backsides, not baseballs.\" Former manager Gene Mauch famously quipped \"He should be in the Hall of Fame with a tube of K-Y Jelly attached to his plaque.\"\\nGene Tenace, who caught Gaylord Perry when they played for the San Diego Padres, said: \"I can remember a couple of occasions when I couldn\\'t throw the ball back to him because it was so greasy that it slipped out of my hands. I just walked out to the mound and flipped the ball back to him.\"\\nPerry used his reputation to psyche out the hitters as well. As he looked in to his catcher for the pitch selection, Perry would touch various parts of his head, such as his eyebrows and his cap. In this manner, he may or may not have been applying a foreign substance to the ball on any particular pitch. Reggie Jackson was so upset after striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game. Jackson returned from the dugout with a container of Gatorade, splashing Gatorade onto the field while yelling at the umpire that Perry should be allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball.\\nThe spitball was not his only method for upsetting batters. Sports Illustrated\\u200a\\'\\u200bs Joe Posnanski wrote of Perry, \"My favorite trick pitch of his was the old Puffball, where he would load up on rosin so that a puff of white smoke would release while he threw his pitches. This was made illegal somewhere along the way (because of Perry, of course), but it\\u2019s so awesome \\u2014 it\\u2019s like the sort of thing one of the villains on the old Batman TV show would do.\"\\n\\n\\n== Professional career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Minor leagues ===\\nPerry played semi-professional in Alpine, Texas at Kokernot Field in the early 1950s for the Alpine Cowboys. Bobby Biedermann was his catcher and roommate.\\nPerry was signed by the San Francisco Giants on June 3, 1958 for $90,000, which was a big contract at the time. He spent 1958 with the St. Cloud, Minnesota team in Class A Northern League, compiling a 9\\u20135 record and a 2.39 ERA. In 1959 he was promoted to the Class AA Corpus Christi Giants, where he posted a less impressive 10\\u201311 record and 4.05 ERA. He remained with the team as they became the Rio Grande Valley Giants in 1960, and an improved ERA of 2.82 earned him a promotion to the Class AAA Tacoma Giants for the 1961 season. At Tacoma, he led the Pacific Coast League in wins and inning pitched in 1961.\\nHe had a brief call-up to the Major Leagues in 1962, making his debut on April 14 against the Cincinnati Reds. He appeared in 13 games in 1962, but had a high 5.23 ERA and was sent back down to Tacoma for the remainder of the year. With the addition of Perry, Bill James called that 1962 Tacoma squad, which featured numerous future major league players, the best minor league lineup of the 1960s.\\n\\n\\n=== San Francisco Giants (1962\\u201371) ===\\nAfter his brief call-up in 1962, Perry joined the Giants in 1963 to work mostly as a relief pitcher that year, posting a mediocre 4.03 ERA in 31 appearances. Nevertheless, in 1964 he was given the opportunity to join the starting rotation, finishing with a 2.75 ERA and a 12\\u201311 record, both second best for the Giants that year behind Juan Marichal. In 1965 his record was 8\\u201312, and with two full seasons as a starter, his 24\\u201330 record attracted little national attention.\\nPerry\\'s breakout season came in 1966 with a tremendous start, going 20\\u20132 into August. Perry and Marichal became known as a \"1\\u20132 punch\" to rival the famous Koufax/Drysdale combination of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Perry played in his first All-Star game, but after August, he slumped the rest of the season, finishing 21\\u20138, and the Giants finished second to the Dodgers. Marichal missed much of the 1967 season with a leg injury, and Perry was thrust into the role of team ace. While he finished the season with a disappointing 15\\u201317 record, he had a low ERA and allowed only 7 hits per 9 innings pitched.\\nPerry had similar numbers in 1968: he posted a 16-15 record, but with a then-career-best 2.45 ERA on a Giants team that finished second to the St. Louis Cardinals. On September 17 of that year, two days after his 30th birthday, Perry no-hit the Cardinals and Bob Gibson 1-0 at Candlestick Park. The lone run came on a first-inning home run by light-hitting Ron Hunt\\u2014the second of the only two he would hit that season. The very next day, the Cardinals returned the favor on the Giants on a 2\\u20130 no-hitter by Ray Washburn\\u2014the first time in Major League history that back-to-back no-hitters had been pitched in the same series.\\nIn 1969, Perry led the league in innings pitched, but the Giants finished second in the pennant race for the fifth straight season. Perry took over as the Giants\\' ace in 1970, and led the league both in wins (23) and innings pitched (328). Perry\\'s strong 1970 performance salvaged the Giants season, helping them finish above .500 but in third place. In 1971, the Giants finally won their division, with Perry posting a 2.76 ERA. In what would be his only two postseason appearances, Perry won one game and lost the other against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\\n\\n\\n=== Cleveland Indians (1972\\u201375) ===\\nBefore the 1972 season, the Giants traded the then 32-year-old Perry and shortstop Frank Duffy to the Cleveland Indians for 29-year-old flamethrower Sam McDowell, the ace of the Indians\\' staff. After that trade Perry went on to win 180 more games in his career while McDowell won only 24 more.\\nPerry went 24\\u201316 in 1972 with a 1.92 ERA and 1 save, winning his first Cy Young award. He stood as the only Cy Young winner for Cleveland until 2007 (CC Sabathia). Perry continued as Cleveland\\'s staff ace until 1975. He went 70\\u201357 during his time in Cleveland, but the team never finished above 4th place. Perry accounted for 39% of all Cleveland wins during his tenure. Tensions between him and player-manager Frank Robinson led to Perry\\'s trade to Texas in June 1975. Gaylord Perry remained as Cleveland\\'s last 20-game winner (21 wins in 1974), until Cliff Lee in 2008.\\n\\n\\n=== Texas Rangers (1975\\u201377) ===\\nOn June 13, 1975, at the start of a three-game series with the Texas Rangers, the Indians traded Perry to the Rangers in exchange for pitchers Jim Bibby, Jackie Brown, and Rick Waits. Perry was feuding with Indians player/manager Frank Robinson. Perry would win nearly 80 more games in his career than the three combined. With the Rangers, Perry formed a one-two punch with Fergie Jenkins, with Perry earning 12 wins, and Jenkins 11, during the remainder of 1975. However, the Rangers, who had finished 2nd in the AL West in 1974, slipped to 3rd place that year.\\nThe next year, with Jenkins moving to Boston, the 37-year-old Perry became the staff ace, winning 15 games against 14 defeats. The Rangers, however, slipped to 4th place in the AL West. But then, in 1977, the Rangers surged to 2nd place in the AL West, winning 94 games, a total that the franchise would not surpass until 1999. Perry again won 15 games, this time against only 12 defeats, in a rotation that included double-digit winners Doyle Alexander, Bert Blyleven, and Dock Ellis.\\n\\n\\n=== San Diego Padres (1978\\u201379) ===\\nBefore the 1978 season San Diego acquired Perry from Texas in exchange for middle reliever Dave Tomlin and $125,000. The 39-year old Perry wound up winning the Cy Young Award going 21\\u20136 for San Diego while the 29-year-old Tomlin never pitched for Texas and pitched barely 150 innings the rest of his career. Perry\\'s 21 wins in 1978 accounted for 25% of the club\\'s victories all year long, and he became the first pitcher to win Cy Young awards in both leagues. In this season he became the third pitcher to strike out 3,000 batters, accomplishing the feat two weeks after his 40th birthday.\\nIn 1979, Perry posted a 3.05 ERA and an 12\\u201311 record before quitting the team on September 5, saying he would retire unless the club traded him back to Texas. The Padres traded Perry to the Texas Rangers on February 15, 1980.\\n\\n\\n=== Texas Rangers/New York Yankees (1980) ===\\nIn 1980, Perry posted a 6\\u20139 record and 3.43 ERA in 24 games with Texas before being traded to the Yankees on August 13, 1980 for minor leaguers Ken Clay and a player to be named later (Marvin Thompson). Many Yankees players had complained about Perry during his stints with the Rangers, and the club even used a special camera team to monitor his movements during one of his starts at Yankee Stadium. Perry finished the season with a 4\\u20134 record for the Yankees.\\n\\n\\n=== Atlanta Braves (1981) ===\\nPerry\\'s contract was up after the 1980 season and he signed a one-year, $300,000 contract with the Atlanta Braves. During the strike-shortened 1981 season, Perry, the oldest player at the time in Major League baseball, started 23 games (150.7 innings) and had an 8\\u20139 record. The Braves released Perry after the season, leaving him three victories short of 300.\\n\\n\\n=== Seattle Mariners/Kansas City Royals (1982\\u201383) ===\\nAfter being released by the Braves, Perry was unable to find interest from any clubs, and missed his first spring training in 23 years.\\nHe eventually signed with the Seattle Mariners, where he acquired the nickname \"Ancient Mariner\", and won his 300th game on May 6, 1982, the first pitcher to win 300 since Early Wynn did so in 1963. On August 23 of that year, he was ejected from a game against the Boston Red Sox for doctoring the ball, and given a 10-day suspension. It was the second time Perry had been ejected in his entire career, and it was his first ejection for ball doctoring.\\nAfter starting the 1983 season 3\\u201310, Perry was designated for assignment by Seattle on June 26 and the Kansas City Royals picked him on a waiver claim 10 days later. In August, Perry became the third pitcher in history to record 3,500 strikeouts. On July 24 he took the pine tar bat that was used to call George Brett out against the Yankees and tried to hide it from the umpires. In the final months of the season, Perry experimented with a submarine delivery for the first time in his career and took a no-hitter into the eighth inning against the first-place Baltimore Orioles on August 19.\\nIn 1983, he became the third pitcher in the same year to surpass longtime strikeout king Walter Johnson\\'s record of 3,509 strikeouts. Steve Carlton and Nolan Ryan were the others.\\nHe announced his retirement on September 23, 1983.\\n\\n\\n== Post-playing career ==\\n\\nPerry retired in 1983 after pitching for eight teams (the San Francisco Giants, Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers (twice), San Diego Padres, New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves, Seattle Mariners and Kansas City Royals). It was during his time with Seattle that he kicked noted Second City actor Jim Zulevic out of a late night party in a Chicago hotel.\\nPerry retired to his 500-acre (2.0 km2) farm in Martin County, North Carolina where he grew tobacco and peanuts, but had to file for bankruptcy in 1986. He briefly worked for Fiesta Foods as a sales manager, and later in the year Limestone College in Gaffney, South Carolina chose Perry to be the College\\u2019s first baseball coach. Perry was there until 1991 when he retired.\\nDespite his admission of illegal pitches he was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1991 and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 1999 The Sporting News ranked him 97th on their list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.\\nPerry supported the Republican Party, campaigned for Jesse Helms and contemplated a bid for Congress himself in 1986.\\nOn July 23, 2005 the San Francisco Giants retired Perry\\'s uniform number 36.\\nPerry was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame on March 9, 2009.\\nHe was honored on April 9, 2011 at AT&T Park with a 2010 World Series World Series ring along with other San Francisco Giants greats Willie McCovey, Orlando Cepeda, and Willie Mays. Of the four, only Mays, as a member of the 1954 team, had previously received a World Series ring from playing for the Giants.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nDue to the number of games Perry lost (265) and lack of postseason glory, the Washington Post called Perry\\'s bid for the Hall of Fame \"dubious\". Bill James lists Perry as having the 10th best career of any right-handed starting pitcher, and the 50th greatest player at any position. In 1999, The Sporting News placed Perry at number 97 on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Baseball Players.\"\\n\\n\\n== Pitching statistics ==\\nPerry is one of five pitchers to win the Cy Young Award in both the American and National League (Pedro Mart\\xednez, Roger Clemens, Randy Johnson, and Roy Halladay being the others). He held the record for most consecutive 15-win seasons since 1900 with 13 (1966\\u20131978) and was 2nd all-time to Cy Young, who had 15 (1891\\u20131905). Greg Maddux surpassed both men, with 17 in a row (1988\\u20132004).\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nPerry\\'s wife, Blanche Manning Perry, died on September 11, 1987 when another car ran a stop sign and hit her car broadside on U.S. Route 27 in Lake Wales, Florida.\\nDaughters: Amy, Beth, and Allison.

The 2.7-mile (4.3 km) system was built by Matra at a cost of $127 million, and began its operation on May 6, 1993. It can accommodate up to 2,400 passengers per hour.\\n\\n\\n== Service ==\\nThe ATS runs 24 hours a day and is free of charge to ride between its five stations located throughout the airport. Each station is fully handicapped accessible, and features elevator access. The travel time from the beginning to the end of the line is approximately nine minutes at an average speed of 26 mph.\\nThe entire system uses platform screen doors, which means that all the stations are enclosed with doors along the boarding area. When the train arrives at a station, the doors of the train and the station align and open in sync with each other. This method prevents people from leaving the platform, falling on the tracks or tampering with restricted areas. Climate control is also ensured since the four terminal stations are directly connected to the airport.\\nThere are two or three cars in each train, and each car can hold 57 passengers, most of them standing, and 8 seated.\\nThe previous bus system took twice as long when traffic was light, and even longer during congestions.\\n\\n\\n=== Stations ===\\nThe system has two tracks, and stops at all five stations in both directions.\\nIt has its west end at Terminal 1, which is located inside the airport\\'s domestic terminal loop, and makes a counterclockwise loop around the parking garage, with stops at Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. Parking Garage A is accessible from any of the three domestic terminal stations, as is the O\\'Hare \\'L\\' station of the CTA\\'s Blue Line. Parking Lots B and C are only accessible from Terminal 1 and 3 stations, respectively.\\nOutside the domestic terminal loop, the ATS has a long stretch that connects to Terminal 5, the airport\\'s international terminal, which is adjacent to Parking Lot D. Access to and from this terminal is only available by riding the ATS. North of Terminal 5, the ATS turns north, crosses over the access road and Blue Line, and reaches the Remote Parking area, located within Parking Lot E, one of airport\\'s three long-term parking lots. The station also features a Pace bus stop and a \"Kiss \\'n\\' Fly\" drop-off area. As of July 15, 2014 until November 2014, shuttle bus will replace the section between Terminal 5 and the \"Kiss \\'n\\' Fly\" drop-off area, while modifications are made to one of the bridges.  Shuttle buses operate 24 hours a day to and from this station to connect passengers with Parking Lots F and G. A shuttle bus also connects this station with the O\\'Hare Metra station on the North Central Service line to Chicago Union Station inbound and Antioch outbound during the train\\'s service hours.\\n\\n\\n== Fleet ==\\nThe ATS uses the French-based VAL technology, which features fully automated, rubber-tired people mover cars. The system is capable of traveling at speeds of up to 50 mph (80 km/h), and was the first to use the 256-type vehicle, named for its width of 2.56 m (8 ft 5 in). The airport originally obtained 13 256-type cars to be used in the system, and two additional cars later were purchased from Jacksonville, Florida\\'s JTA Skyway after the Jacksonville Transportation Authority decided to switch to a more cost-effective technology. Out of the system\\'s 15 cars, only 12 of them are utilized at the moment, with three held in reserve. Currently, the ATS is one of two systems in the world to use the 256-type cars, with the other being the Wenshan Line of the Taipei Rapid Transit System.\\n\\n\\n== Future enhancements ==\\nTo improve efficiency at O\\'Hare, a modernization plan has been implemented, which also includes changes to the ATS. The current system has not been upgraded since the system was launched in 1993, and changes will be made to reduce the long station wait times as well as the crowdedness of the trains. The new system enhancements will cost around US $90 million, and will include 24 new people mover cars, plus an extension of the line past the current terminus at Parking Lot E to connect with a future remote parking garage near Economy Lot F. It is also in the plans to add a shuttle bus system that will run from the rental car facility to the airport 24 hours a day similar to Midway Airport shuttle bus system.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n Media related to Airport Transit System at Wikimedia Commons', u'ITV Emergency National Service': u\"The ITV Emergency National Service was the management response to the near-complete Independent Television technicians' strike immediately after the 1968 franchise changes took effect.\\nDuring the national ITV technicians' strike of August 1968, the individual companies were off the air for several weeks and an emergency service was presented by management personnel with no regional variations. This was the first time that a uniform presentation practice was adopted across all regions. This did not happen again until ITV's first few days back on air following the technicians' strike of 1979, which blacked out the channel for 75 days.\\n\\n\\n== Presentation ==\\nAll programmes played during the service were repeats or had been pre-made for forthcoming transmission. Other than continuity, there was no live material. The programmes were transmitted from the Associated TeleVision switching centre at Foley Street in London, while a team of ex-ABC announcers based in both Teddington and Foley Street provided presentation.\\nThe announcing team for the special service was mainly David Hamilton, John Benson, Sheila Kennedy and Philip Elsmore, who would all continue as Thames announcers when the regional services restarted at the end of the strike.\\nThe service was mounted at short notice after several days of blank screens. The management team behind the emergency service had needed to create a quick and simple Independent Television national presentation style. The term 'Independent Television' was chosen for the 'temporary national station' (the term 'ITV' was relatively little used until the 1970s) and a range of simple, text-only captions was provided.\\nNo station symbol was used - the ident was simply the name in upper-case characters. A clock was borrowed from the ABC studios at Teddington and the ABC triangle on the clock was mostly covered with tape.\\n\\n\\n== Tuning signals ==\\nOn the first day of the service, an insert of the local 'Picasso' tuning signal was tried along with a local start-up tune before switching to the national output. On day two, a London 'Picasso' and national theme was used. From day three, a networked tuning signal was used. To avoid confusion over regions, the ITA provided the Foley Street centre with a copy of the blank 'Picasso' containing no regional identifier. A version with the words 'Independent Television' was commissioned but did not arrive until the final few days of the service and was only used briefly at the end of the period.\\n\\n\\n== Daily opening music ==\\nThis short service was not wholly consistent in presentation, and opened on some days with Picasso card and ident, whilst on other days only the ident card appeared. A march (Here Comes The Band by Robert Farnon, which also featured in The Prisoner) was chosen as the daily opening music.\\n\\n\\n== Advertising ==\\nWith a national service being provided, all advertising spots needed to be sold on a national basis. Therefore a new rate card was introduced, charging \\xa32000 for 30 seconds of advertising time before 7pm and \\xa33500 after 7pm. Prior to the strike, a 30 second advert in the London region alone would have cost \\xa31,200. Although large national companies benefited from the lower rates, local companies who had previously advertised in their relevant region only were unable to do so during the Emergency National Service.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nVision On\\nA version of this article originally appeared on the Transdiffusion group of websites; the text was released under the GFDL.\", u'1890 Cincinnati Reds season': u'The 1890 Cincinnati Reds season was a season in American baseball.

The Reds hired Tom Loftus as their new manager. He last managed the Cleveland Spiders in 1889, leading them to a 61\\u201372 record and a sixth place finish in the National League.\\nIn the off-season, the Reds acquired Lefty Marr from the Columbus Solons for $2000. Marr had hit .306 with a league high 15 triples for the Solons in 1889. He had also appeared in eight games with the Red Stockings in 1886. The team also purchased the contract of pitcher Frank Foreman from the Baltimore Orioles. Foreman was 23\\u201321 with a 3.52 with the Orioles. Cincinnati also signed two 21-year-olds, catcher Jerry Harrington and pitcher Billy Rhines. Joe Knight, who last appeared in the majors with the Philadelphia Quakers in 1884 as a pitcher, was signed to play the outfield.\\nJohn Reilly led the club offensively, hitting .300 with team highs with six home runs and 86 RBI. Bid McPhee had a .256 average with three homers and 39 RBI, as well as team highs with 125 runs and 55 stolen bases. Knight led the club with a .312 average with four homers and 67 RBI in his only season in the majors. Rhines led the pitching staff, as he had a 28\\u201317 record with league best 1.95 ERA.\\n\\n\\n=== Season summary ===\\nThe Reds played their first National League game on April 19, 1890. Despite a home run from Bug Holliday, Cincinnati lost to the Chicago Colts by a 5\\u20134 score.

It connects with the A train at Broad Channel station and is the latest iteration of the Rockaway Shuttle services that have been running in the Rockaway peninsula since 1956. This shuttle train provides service to the western part of the peninsula, with a terminus at Rockaway Park \\u2013 Beach 116th Street. It operates on trackage that was originally part of the Long Island Rail Road\\'s Far Rockaway Branch until the mid-1950s. It is colored dark slate gray on route signs, station signs, rolling stock, and the official subway map. The internal designator for this service is H, though the MTA does not show this on any maps, train rollsigns, or schedules.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe Rockaway Shuttle started operating on June 28, 1956. During its early years, it essentially provided non-rush hour and weekend service between Euclid Avenue and either Far Rockaway \\u2013 Mott Avenue or Rockaway Park \\u2013 Beach 116th Street. At first, the route did not have an official assigned letter code on maps, although sometimes trains displayed either the A or E route on their rollsign boxes.\\n\\nBeginning on February 1, 1962, the Rockaway Shuttle was officially lettered on maps and trains as HH. From November 26, 1967 to September 10, 1972, it was colored red, with daytime non-rush hour and weekend service usually available between Rockaway Park and Euclid Avenue or Broad Channel, plus some weekday mid-afternoon service provided between Far Rockaway and Euclid Avenue.\\nDuring the late night-early morning hours, service operating to and from Euclid Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line in Brooklyn was extended between roughly midnight and 6:00 a.m., which were the hours when the A did not run to and from Far Rockaway. At those times, the HH would operate from Euclid Avenue to Rockaway Park, then to Far Rockaway via Hammels Wye, and finally back to Euclid Avenue, thus earning this night owl service the unofficial nickname as Rockaway Round-Robin.\\nBetween September 11, 1972 and August 29, 1976, the shuttle\\'s identifier was known as the E (colored aqua blue), although during rush hours this train was extended all the way to Jamaica \\u2013 179th Street on the IND Queens Boulevard Line in Queens. Afterward, the designation CC (colored green) was used for the shuttle, although during rush hours this train was extended all the way to Bedford Park Boulevard on the IND Concourse Line in the Bronx.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, the shuttle\\'s identifier was changed to H (colored blue) instead of reverting to HH, as the New York City subway system had abolished two-letter designations by then. Prior to 1993, late night A service went to Lefferts Boulevard with no service to Far Rockaway. During this time again, the Rockaway Shuttle ran from Rockaway Park to Far Rockaway, to Euclid Avenue, and finally, back down to Rockaway Park.\\nIn 1993, service was changed. All late night A service traveled to Far Rockaway and service to Lefferts Boulevard was provided by a shuttle to Euclid Avenue. The Rockaway Park Shuttle now ran between Rockaway Park and Broad Channel at all times. Also in 1993, special A diamond service began running from Rockaway Park to Dyckman on the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Inwood, Manhattan, during the morning rush (later Inwood \\u2013 207th Street) and from 59th Street \\u2013 Columbus Circle (now 168th Street) to Rockaway Park during the evening rush.\\n\\nFormerly, some maps had shown the current S service in blue, but this had never been used on trains. Since May 2004, the official system map shows the Rockaway Park Shuttle as carrying a grey bullet. Recent prints, however, depicted the service itself in blue, but has been changed back to grey, as of January 2013. In order to distinguish it from the other shuttles, NYCT Rapid Transit operations still refers to it internally as the H.\\n The Rockaway Park Shuttle was suspended following the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, due to track being washed out between Broad Channel and Howard Beach. On November 20, 2012, a free shuttle designated as H replaced the Rockaway portion of the A service between Far Rockaway \\u2013 Mott Avenue and Beach 90th Street via the Hammels Wye. Additionally, the remainder of the Rockaway Line from Beach 90th Street to Rockaway Park was damaged and awaited repair. With the emergency implementation of this service, the H rollsign designation returned to public usage for the first time since 1993. On May 30, 2013, full service to the Rockaways was restored. The free H service was discontinued.\\n\\n\\n== Stations ==\\nFor a more detailed station listing, see IND Rockaway Line.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nMTA NYC Transit \\u2013 Rockaway Park Shuttle\\n\"S Subway Timetable, Rockaway Park Shuttle, Effective December 7, 2014\".

Retrieved August 2014.', u'Independent Television Service for Wales and the West': u'Independent Television Service for Wales and the West or ITSWW is a unique entity within the history of ITV.\\nOn 11 June 1967 the Independent Television Authority (ITA) had announced changes to the structure and contracts of the ITV network in the United Kingdom, to take effect in July 1968. Several changes were announced that would have far-reaching effects for British television. The UK press decided that the most dramatic news was the loss of the Wales and West contract, held by TWW since 1958, to a consortium headed by and named after Lord Harlech.\\nTWW spent some months fighting the decision, including some acrimonious exchanges with the ITA in the press. However, the ITA remained resolute that it was legally entitled to remove any contract at any time for any reason, and the board of TWW eventually accepted this and announced it would carry on providing a programme service to the area until the end of the contract period.\\nITSWW is generally not mentioned in history books (Bernard Sendall\\'s otherwise complete history of the ITA\\'s operations makes no mention of the service) and was rapidly all but forgotten.\\n\\n\\n== Problems with TWW ==\\nAlthough a condition of the new incumbent\\'s licence was that all technical, office and engineering staff of the old company should be taken on (the standard ITA practice at the time), it was becoming obvious that the new contractor, Harlech Television, intended to dismiss all the on-screen personnel of TWW, and launch with a fresh team. These intentions had a marked effect on TWW morale and programme production became more difficult as the winter of 1967\\u201368 wore on.\\nAdditionally, the board of TWW had been advised not to take the stake in Harlech offered to them by the ITA. TWW had other subsidiaries, but none were as profitable or fast growing as the television business. This depressed the TWW share price.\\nEarly in 1968, the TWW board decided that more money would be realised for shareholders in the eventual winding up of the company if they were to \"sell\" the last part of the old contract to the incoming consortium. This would provide a fixed guaranteed income for the final months of TWW and give some underpinning to the share price. TWW\\'s accountants advanced this plan, and the ITA, who thought it would bring more stability to the situation, backed it.\\nIt was calculated that the profit after expenses that TWW might have made would be about \\xa3100,000 per month and that the earliest that TWW could reasonably exit would be around the end of February 1968. It was agreed to sell the last five months of the contract to Harlech for just under \\xa3500,000.\\nHowever, Harlech were not yet in a position to begin production and would therefore have to launch their promised new service using \"in the can\" TWW productions; This was not an ideal situation for a replacement franchisee.\\n\\n\\n== ITA solution ==\\nThe ITA suggested a solution, where the sale of the contract would go ahead, Harlech would receive all advertising revenue from the handover date and would pay TWW a fixed weekly fee to continue making local productions for a further five months. During that time Harlech would be preparing its own programmes, using the same studios and staff, for launch in the summer. The interim contract would use neither company\\'s name, and the literal Independent Television Service for Wales and the West was chosen.\\nThis created a cordon sanitaire between the end of TWW and the start of Harlech. Nevertheless, the \"in the can\" TWW productions, of which there were many, still carried \"TWW presents\" and \"TWW production\" captions.\\nAlso, TWW in-vision announcers were retained by the interim set up, giving a superficial impression that little had changed. This was referred to in the local press as \"TWW\\'s revenge\" on Harlech. In the event, Harlech decided that the confusion was not helping, and brought forward their own start date to late May. The interim service lasted just under three months.\\nThe interim service continued both of the former TWW dual services under the names \\'South Wales and West\\' and \\'Teledu Cymru\\' \\u2013 the latter having been the existing on-air name in that area. For the interim period, both names were prefixed with the new phrase \"Independent Television Service\". Thus the new ITSWW (the initials were never used on air, and mainly served as an abbreviation used by the newspapers) was operating two channels known as ITSSWW and ITSTC respectively. What the viewers made of all this is unclear, but extensive broadsheet press advertising was taken out to explain the arrangements to those viewers deemed to be interested. Nothing was placed in the tabloids.\\n\\n\\n== Idents ==\\nA temporary ident was designed, with four white horizontal bars shooting towards the viewer, electronic music and the name revealing itself a line at a time. The former TWW clock was retained, as were the in-vision announcers.\\n\\n\\n== References ==', u'Platform screen doors': u'Platform screen doors (PSDs) and platform edge doors (PEDs) at train or subway stations screen the platform from the train. They are a relatively new addition to many metro systems around the world, some having been retrofitted to established systems. They are widely used in Asian and European metro systems. The first station in the world with platform screen doors is Park Pobedy (Russian: \\u041f\\u0430\\u0440\\u043a \\u041f\\u043e\\u0431\\u0435\\u0301\\u0434\\u044b) in the Saint Petersburg Metro that was opened in 1961.\\n\\n\\n== Door types ==\\nAlthough the terms are often used interchangeably, platform screen doors are full height, total barriers between the station floor and ceiling, while platform edge doors are full height but do not reach the ceiling and thus do not create a total barrier.\\n\\n\\n=== Platform screen doors ===\\nThese doors help to:\\nPrevent accidental falls off the platform onto the lower track area, suicide attempts and homicides by pushing.\\nPrevent or reduce wind felt by the passengers caused by the piston effect which could in some circumstances make people fall over\\nReduce the risk of accidents, especially from service trains passing through the station at high speeds.\\nImprove climate control within the station (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning are more effective when the station is physically isolated from the tunnel).\\nImprove security \\u2014 access to the tracks and tunnels is restricted.\\nLower costs \\u2014 eliminate the need for motormen or conductors when used in conjunction with Automatic Train Operation, thereby reducing manpower costs.\\nPrevent litter build up on the track, which can be a fire risk.\\nImprove the sound quality of platform announcements, as background noise from the tunnels and trains that are entering or exiting is reduced.\\nTheir primary disadvantage is their cost; installing a system typically costs several million USD per station. When used to retrofit older systems, they limit the kind of rolling stock that may be used on a line, as train doors must have exactly the same spacing as the platform doors; this results in additional costs due to depot upgrades and otherwise unnecessary purchases of rolling stock.\\nThe doors also pose their own safety risks. The primary risk is that people may be trapped between the platform doors and the train carriage, and be subsequently crushed when the train begins to move (see Accidents). Cases of this happening are rare, and may depend upon door design.\\n\\n\\n=== Automatic platform gate ===\\nAutomatic platform gates (or half-height platform screen doors as referred to by some manufacturers) are chest-height sliding doors at the edge of railway platforms to prevent passengers from falling off the platform edge onto the railway tracks. Like full-height platform screen doors, these platform gates slide open or closed simultaneously with the train doors.\\nHalf-height platform gates are cheaper to install than platform screen doors, which require more metallic framework for support. Some railway operators may therefore prefer such an option to improve safety at railway platforms and, at the same time, keep costs low and non-air-conditioned platforms naturally ventilated. However, these gates are less effective than full platform screen doors in preventing people from intentionally jumping onto the tracks.\\nThese gates are firstly in practical use by Hong Kong metro system, MTR on Disneyland Resort Line for their open-air stations design. The later design by other manufacturers, such as Manusa or Gilgen Door Systems AG, have their gates higher than the one installed on Disneyland Resort Line.\\n\\n\\n==== Examples ====\\nBeijing subway, China - Line 5\\nParis M\\xe9tro, France - Line 1, Line 14 and Line 13\\nMTR Disneyland Resort Line, Island Line, Kwun Tong Line, Tsuen Wan Line, Hong Kong\\nFukuoka City Subway, Japan\\nOsaka Municipal Subway (Imazatosuji Line, Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line, Sennichimae Line), Japan\\nTokyo Monorail, Tokyo Metro, Toei Metro, Japan\\nSentosa Express, Singapore\\nMass Rapid Transit, Singapore - Platform Screen Door, all lines\\nTaipei Metro, Taiwan, Nangang Line, Tamsui Line\\nNorth- South Terminal shuttle, London Gatwick Airport.\\nThe Dubai Metro - Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\\n\\n\\n== Usage ==\\n\\n\\n=== Australia ===\\nThe North West Rail Link in Sydney will open in 2019 and will be the first fully automated rapid transit rail system in Australia. The new stations will be equipped with full height platform screen doors on underground platforms and half height on at grade/elevated platforms. The existing 5 stations on the Epping to Chatswood railway line will be upgraded to rapid transit standard, all featuring half height platform screen doors. \\n\\n\\n=== Brazil ===\\nThe S\\xe3o Paulo Metro has nine stations with platform screen doors (PSDs): Sacom\\xe3 station (Line 2 - Green) opened on January 30, 2010 with this feature. On May 25, 2010, Faria Lima and Paulista stations (Line 4 - Yellow) opened featuring PSDs; on August 21, 2010, Vila Prudente Station was opened with PSDs and on September 21, 2010, Tamanduate\\xed Station was also opened with PSDs. Stations Butant\\xe3, Pinheiros, Rep\\xfablica, and Luz of Line 4 - Yellow, opened in 2011 with PSDs. All the future stations of the system will be inaugurated with PSDs. They are planned to be installed in the old stations as well.\\n\\n\\n=== Canada ===\\nScreen doors are in use at all three LINK Train stations and future Union Pearson Express stations at Toronto Pearson International Airport in Mississauga, Ontario.\\n\\n\\n=== China ===\\nA number of Chinese cities have started to install platform screen doors. Systems such as Shanghai Metro, Beijing Subway, Guangzhou Metro, and Shenzhen Metro have adopted the platform screen doors.\\n\\n\\n=== Denmark ===\\nThe Copenhagen Metro uses Westinghouse and Faiveley platform screen doors on its underground stations platforms.\\n\\n\\n=== Finland ===\\nThe Helsinki Metro is currently conducting a trial run with Faiveley automatic platform gates installed on a single platform at Vuosaari metro station during phase one of the project. The doors, which are part of the Siemens metro automation project, were built over a year ago. Phase 2 of the project has been delayed due to metro automation technical and safety related testings.\\n\\n\\n=== France ===\\nParis M\\xe9tro\\'s line 14 from Saint-Lazare to Biblioth\\xe8que Fran\\xe7ois Mitterrand was inaugurated with Faiveley platform screen doors. The new station Olympiades opened with platform screen doors in June 2007. Line 1 has been retrofitted with platform screen doors, for full driverless automation effective in 2012. Some stations on Line 13 also has had platform edge doors since 2010 due to overcrowding, after tests were conducted in 2006.\\nIn addition, all lines of the VAL automated subway system are also equipped with platform screen doors at every station. Those include Toulouse, Rennes and Lille subways, as well as the CDGVAL and Orlyval airport shuttles.\\nThe D line in Lyon, equipped with full automated trainset, isn\\'t equipped with platform screen doors but by infrared detectors upon the tracks.\\n\\n\\n=== Hong Kong ===\\n\\nIn 1998, the Tung Chung Line and Airport Express saw the earliest operations of platform screen doors in Hong Kong. Since then, the MTR Corporation began to retrofit 2,960 pairs of screen doors at all the underground stations of the MTR network, the first in the world to retrofit PSDs on a transit system already in operation. The project was completed in October 2005. The remaining eight at-grade or elevated stations of the former MTR network (i.e. excluding former KCR stations) were retrofitted with automatic platform gates in 2011.\\nPlatform screen doors were also installed on all platforms of the West Rail Line, then built by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) before the MTR-KCR merger.\\nThe longest set of platform screen doors in the world can be found in East Tsim Sha Tsui Station, but a reduction of train length from 12 to 7 cars following by the construction of Kowloon Southern Link, caused many of the screen doors to be put out of service.\\nThe last stations in Hong Kong without platform screen doors or gates are all found on the East Rail Line and Ma On Shan Line, both former KCR lines not part of the MTR APG retrofitting programmes. However, these remaining stations are all being retrofitted as part of the Sha Tin to Central Link project.\\nBesides the MTR, all stations on the Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover are equipped with platform screen doors.\\n\\n\\n=== India ===\\nPlatform screen doors are used in all the platforms on Delhi Airport Metro Express, a Delhi Metro line which links New Delhi Metro Station to Dwarka Sector 21, linking the Indira Gandhi International Airport at a speed of 135 kmph. There have been plan to install platform screen doors on Line 1 and Line 2 of the Kolkata Metro. Kochi Metro plans to install platform screen door in all upcoming stations. Chennai metro rail limited, a rapid urban transit system in the city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, will have platform screen doors installed in all underground stations. Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ underground metro in Mumbai too has a plan to install platform screen doors.\\n\\n\\n=== Italy ===\\nPlatform screen doors are used in most of the rapid transit systems of new construction in Italy, in particular in the Turin Metro, the Venice People Mover, the Perugia Minimetr\\xf2, the Brescia Metro and the Line 5 of the Milan Metro.\\n\\n\\n=== Japan ===\\nThe Tokyo Metro began installing barriers in 1991, with the opening of the Namboku Line, and subsequently on the Marunouchi and Fukutoshin lines.\\nIn August 2012 the Japanese government announced plans to install barriers at stations used by 100,000 or more people per day, and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism allotted 36 million yen ($470,800) for research and development of the system the 2011-2012 fiscal year. A difficulty was the fact that some stations are used by different types of trains with different designs, making barrier design a challenge.\\nAs of November 2012, only 34 of 235 stations with over 100,000 users per day were able to implement the plan. The ministry stated that 539 of approximately 9,500 train stations across Japan have barriers. Of the Tokyo Metro stations, 78 of 179 have some type of platform barrier.\\n\\n\\n=== Malaysia ===\\nPlatform screen doors are installed at all underground Kelana Jaya Line LRT stations, from Ampang Park to Masjid Jamek LRT stations for safety reasons. The automated announcement message reading \"For safety reasons, please stand behind the yellow line\" in both English and Malay languages are also heard before the train arrived at all LRT stations.\\n\\n\\n=== South Korea ===\\nYongdu Station of Seoul Subway Line 2 was the first station on the Seoul Subway to feature platform screen doors; the station opened in October 2005. By the end of 2009, many of the 289 stations operated by Seoul Metro, Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation (SMRT) by Korean local supplier. SMRT and Seoul Metro Line9 were equipped with platform screen doors However, not all stations operated by Korail have completed installation. All stations in South Korea will have platform screen doors by 2018. As of 2012, 100%, 57.9%, 49.1%, 41.4% and 15.3% of subway stations are equipped with platform screen doors in Daejeon, Gwangju, Busan, Incheon and Daegu respectively. The platform screen doors installed in Nokdong Station on Gwangju Subway have a unique rope-based platform screen named Rope type Platform Safe Door (RPSD). A set of ropes cordones off the platform from the rails. When the train arrives, the rope screen ascends to allow entry.\\n\\n\\n=== Russia ===\\nPark Pobedy (Russian: \\u041f\\u0430\\u0440\\u043a \\u041f\\u043e\\u0431\\u0435\\u0301\\u0434\\u044b) is a station of the Saint Petersburg Metro that was the first station in the world with screen doors. The station was opened in 1961. Later the other nine stations of this type were built in Saint Petersburg (Leningrad): Petrogradskaya (Russian: \\u041f\\u0435\\u0442\\u0440\\u043e\\u0433\\u0440\\u0430\\u0434\\u0441\\u043a\\u0430\\u044f), Vasileostrovskaya (Russian: \\u0412\\u0430\\u0441\\u0438\\u043b\\u0435\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u0440\\u043e\\u0432\\u0441\\u043a\\u0430\\u044f), Gostiny Dvor (Russian: \\u0413\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u0438\\u043d\\u044b\\u0439 \\u0434\\u0432\\u043e\\u0440), Mayakovskaya (Russian: \\u041c\\u0430\\u044f\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432\\u0441\\u043a\\u0430\\u044f), Ploshchad Alexandra Nevskogo I (Russian: \\u041f\\u043b\\u043e\\u0449\\u0430\\u0434\\u044c \\u0410\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0441\\u0430\\u043d\\u0434\\u0440\\u0430 \\u041d\\u0435\\u0432\\u0441\\u043a\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e-1), Moskovskaya (Russian: \\u041c\\u043e\\u0441\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432\\u0441\\u043a\\u0430\\u044f), Yelizarovskaya (Russian: \\u0415\\u043b\\u0438\\u0437\\u0430\\u0440\\u043e\\u0432\\u0441\\u043a\\u0430\\u044f), Lomonosovskaya (Russian: \\u041b\\u043e\\u043c\\u043e\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u043e\\u0432\\u0441\\u043a\\u0430\\u044f), Zvyozdnaya (Russian: \\u0417\\u0432\\u0451\\u0437\\u0434\\u043d\\u0430\\u044f).\\nThere was an electronic device to ensure that the train stopped with its doors adjacent to the platform doors; they were installed so that driverless trains could eventually be used on the line. Unlike other platform screen doors, which are lightweight units with extensive glazing installed on a normal platform edge, the St Petersburg units give the appearance of a solid wall with heavyweight doorways and solid steel sliding doors, similar to a bank of elevators in a large building, and the train cannot be seen entering from the platform; passengers become familiar with the sound alone to indicate a train arrival.\\n\\n\\n=== Singapore ===\\nThe Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) was the first rapid transit system in Asia to incorporate platform screen doors in its stations in 1987. Full height PSDs are installed at all existing underground MRT stations in Singapore and all future underground MRT stations. Half-height platform screen doors have been retrofitted into all stations on 14 March 2012 (starting with three elevated MRT stations by 2009), as well as all future elevated MRT stations. The LRT Station at Sengkang also has platform screen panels installed.\\nThere are two series of the full-height platform screen doors in use. The first was installed at all underground stations along the North South Line and the East West Line from 1987 to the completion of the initial system in 1990. The second series of PSDs sporting a sleeker design, producing less sound when the doors were opened and closed, and incorporating more glass were installed in the Changi Airport MRT Station which opened in 2002. All stations in the fully underground North East Line, which opened in 2003, sport these new doors. The Circle Line features second-generation platform screen doors on all of its stations. They were installed on the North South Line platform in the Bishan MRT Station in 2009 after the opening of the Circle line platforms there.\\nConsidered a novelty at the time of its installation, it was introduced primarily to minimise hefty air-conditioning costs, especially since elevated stations are not air-conditioned and are much more economical to run in comparison. Since then the safety aspects of these doors have become more important, as highlighted by a series of high-profile incidents where individuals were injured or killed by oncoming trains since the year 2002 \\u2014 all occurring on elevated stations with no screen doors. The Land Transport Authority reports that there have been more than 220 cases of commuters trespassing on the tracks between 1991 and 15 September 2004, of which 87 percent were deliberate acts of trespass. Nine fatalities were recorded during this period, of which only one was an accident. Since September 2004 there have been six fatalities occurring on elevated MRT and LRT stations.\\n\\n\\n=== Spain ===\\nHalf platform screens were installed first in Proven\\xe7a FGC station (Barcelona) around 2003. Later doors were tested on Barcelona Metro line 11 before fitting them on all stations for the new lines 9 and 10, which operate driverless. In Seville Metro this system is the one used since it was opened, at April 2009\\n\\n\\n=== Switzerland ===\\nZurich International Airport\\'s Skymetro shuttle between the main building (hosting terminals A and B) and the detached terminal E has glass screen doors separating the tracks from the passenger hall platforms at both ends.\\n\\nLausanne Metro\\'s Line M2 has glass screen doors at every station.\\n\\n\\n=== Taiwan ===\\n\\n\\n==== Taipei ====\\nPlatform screen doors were installed from the beginning with the opening of the then Muzha Line (now the Wenshan line, was the first metro line in Taiwan and in the Republic of China) of the Taipei Metro in 1996. In the 21st century, all platform of the Neihu Line, Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center Station (the terminal of the Nangang Line eastern extension), Xinlu Line (beside Guting Station which platform gates will be soon in use) and the Xinyi Line (beside Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Station which platform gates will be soon in use) are equipped with them. Future extensions and lines will be equipped with those doors. Last station without platform screen doors while getting operational is Nangang Station. Meanwhile, TRTC decided that they will install platform gate to all stations without platform door when they were built and those stations with high amount of passenger or transfer station will be targeted first. Currently, platform gates in major stations like Taipei Main Station and Yuanshan Station are already in use.\\n\\n\\n==== Kaohsiung ====\\nAll underground stations on the Kaohsiung MRT system have platform screen doors installed.\\n\\n\\n=== Thailand ===\\nBangkok\\'s MRT is equipped with platform screen doors. In 2013, Half platform screens were installed on the BTS skytrain at Siam station.\\n\\n\\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\\n\\n\\n==== Dubai ====\\n\\nAutomatic platform gates are used in all the platforms in The Dubai Metro and Dubai Tram, the latter of which is the world\\'s first tram system to feature platform gates.\\n\\n\\n=== United Kingdom ===\\n\\nThe Jubilee line extension project saw platform edge doors installed on its new stations. They were designed primarily to reduce the movement of air caused by emergency ventilation fans which activate in event of a fire, or under test conditions. They were also built as a barrier to prevent people falling or jumping onto the tracks. The Jubilee line PEDs were produced by Westinghouse.\\nPEDs are present on the Gatwick Airport shuttle system and on the Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 airside people mover shuttle.\\n\\n\\n=== United States ===\\n\\nPlatform screen doors are generally rare in the United States, and are almost exclusively found on small-scale systems.\\nIn New York City, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey uses full height platform screen doors at its AirTrain JFK and AirTrain Newark stations. The Metropolitan Transit Authority may, in the future, be including these in several stations along the Second Avenue Subway and the 7 Subway Extension, but their installation presents substantial technical challenges, as there are different placements of doors on New York City Subway rolling stock. The MTA is also interested in retrofitting platform screen doors on the Canarsie Line, along the L train, and on the remainder of the IRT Flushing Line, along the 7 <7> trains. However, it is unlikely that the entire New York City Subway system will get retrofitted with platform screen doors, due to the varying placements of doors on rolling stock.\\nPeople movers, systems that ferry passengers across large distances they would otherwise walk, make use of platform screen doors. These systems are common at airports such as Hartsfield\\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Denver International Airport. San Francisco International Airport has AirTrain which operates 24 hours a day and is a 6-mile long line that operates between the domestic terminal, international terminal, both international garages, and rental car. Each station is fully enclosed with platform screen doors allowing access to the fully automated People mover. Chicago O\\'Hare International Airport has a people mover system which operates 24 hours a day and is a 2.5 mile long (4 km) line that operates between the four terminals at the airport and parking areas. Each station is fully enclosed with platform screen doors allowing access to the fully automated people mover trains. AeroTrain is a 3.78-mile (6.08 km) people mover system at Washington Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia with fully enclosed tracks including platform screen doors. The United States Capitol subway system, a train cart people mover system, uses platform gates.\\nThe privately operated Las Vegas Monorail system is currently the only general-purpose rapid transit system in the US to use platform screen doors. Honolulu Rail Transit will become the first large-scale publicly run metro system in the United States to feature platform screen doors when it opens in 2017.\\n\\n\\n== Accidents ==\\nOn 15 July 2007 in Shanghai, platform-edge doors led to a fatal accident. A man tried to force his way onto a crowded train at the station for the Shanghai Indoor Stadium but failed. When the doors closed, he was sandwiched between the two sets of closed doors. Unable to retreat to the platform due to the closed screen doors behind him, he was pulled under the train, leading to his death.\\nOn November 6, 2014, a woman, Pan Xiaomei, 33, was killed when she tried to board the train at Huixinxijie Nankou Station on Beijing Subway\\'s Line 5. She was attempting to board a train in the midst of an extremely dense mass of passengers, and found herself trapped between the train and the platform screen doors which had closed behind her. The train pulled away from the station several seconds later, crushing her to death. This was the third death linked to subway platform doors in China within the several years preceding it. \\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nPlatform screen doors Metro Bits', u'Canadian': u'Canadians (French: Canadiens) are the people who are identified with the country of Canada. This connection may be residential, legal, historical, and/or cultural. For most Canadians, several (frequently all) of those types of connections exist and are the source(s) of their being considered Canadians.\\nAboriginal peoples, according to the 2011 Canadian Census, numbered at 1,400,685 or 4.3% of the country\\'s 33,476,688 population. The majority of the population is made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants. Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization, different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-aboriginal peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today. Elements of Aboriginal, French, British and more recent immigrant customs, languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada and thus a Canadian identity. Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the United States.\\nCanadian independence from Great Britain grew gradually over the course of many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. World War I and World War II in particular gave rise to a desire amongst Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship. Legislative independence was established with the passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931, the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 took effect on January 1, 1947, and full sovereignty was achieved with the patriation of the constitution in 1982. Canada\\'s nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom. Legislation since the mid 20th century represents Canadians\\' commitment to multilateralism and socioeconomic development.\\n\\n\\n== Population ==\\n\\nAs of 2010 Canadians make up 0.5% of the world\\'s total population, having relied upon immigration for population growth and social development. Approximately 41% of current Canadians are first- or second-generation immigrants, and 20 percent of Canadian residents in the 2000s were not born in the country. Statistics Canada projects that, by 2031, nearly one-half of Canadians above the age of 15 will be foreign-born or have one foreign-born parent.\\n\\n\\n=== Immigration ===\\n\\nThe French originally settled New France, in present-day Quebec and Ontario; and Acadia, in present day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, during the early part of the 17th century. Approximately 100 Irish-born families would settle the Saint Lawrence Valley by 1700, assimilating into the Canadien population and culture. During the 18th and 19th century; immigration westward (to the area known as Rupert\\'s Land) was carried out by \"Voyageurs\"; French settlers working for the North West Company; and by British settlers (English and Scottish) representing the Hudson\\'s Bay Company, coupled with independent entrepreneurial woodsman called \"Coureur des bois\". This arrival of newcomers led to the creation of the M\\xe9tis, an ethnic group of mixed European and First Nations parentage.\\nThe British conquest of New France was preceded by a small number of Germans and Swedes who settled alongside the Scottish in Port Royal, Nova Scotia, while some Irish immigrated to the Colony of Newfoundland. In the wake of the 1775 invasion of Canada by the newly formed Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, approximately 60,000 United Empire Loyalist fled to British North America, a large portion of whom migrated to New Brunswick. After the War of 1812, British (including British army regulars), Scottish and Irish immigration was encouraged throughout Rupert\\'s Land, Upper Canada and Lower Canada.\\nBetween 1815 and 1850, some 800,000 immigrants came to the colonies of British North America, mainly from the British Isles as part of the great migration of Canada. These new arrivals included some Gaelic-speaking Highland Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances to Nova Scotia. The Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s significantly increased the pace of Irish immigration to Prince Edward Island and the Province of Canada, with over 35,000 distressed individuals landing in Toronto in 1847 and 1848. Beginning in the late 1850s, the immigration of Chinese into the Colony of Vancouver Island and Colony of British Columbia peaked with the onset of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. The Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 eventually placed a head tax on all Chinese immigrants, in hopes of discouraging Chinese immigration after completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\\n\\nThe population of Canada has consistently risen, doubling approximately every 40 years, since the establishment of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. From the mid- to late 19th century, Canada had a policy of assisting immigrants from Europe, including an estimated 100,000 unwanted \"Home Children\" from Britain. Block settlement communities were established throughout western Canada between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some were planned and others were spontaneously created by the settlers themselves. Canada was now receiving a large number of European immigrants, predominately Italians, Germans, Scandinavians, Dutch, Poles, and Ukrainians. Legislative restrictions on immigration (such as the Continuous journey regulation and Chinese Immigration Act) that had favoured British and other European immigrants were amended in the 1960s, opening the doors to immigrants from all parts of the world. While the 1950s had still seen high levels of immigration by Europeans, by the 1970s, immigrants were increasingly Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese, Jamaican and Haitian. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Canada received many American Vietnam War draft dissenters. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, Canada\\'s growing Pacific trade brought with it a large influx of South Asians, who tended to settle in British Columbia. Immigrants of all backgrounds tend to settle in the major urban centres.\\nThe majority of illegal immigrants come from the southern provinces of the People\\'s Republic of China, with Asia as a whole, Eastern Europe, Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East all contributing to the illegal population. Estimates of numbers of illegal immigrants range between 35,000 and 120,000. A 2008 report by the Auditor General of Canada Sheila Fraser stated that Canada has lost track of approximately 41,000 illegal immigrants whose visas have expired.\\n\\n\\n=== Citizenship and diaspora ===\\n\\nCanadian citizenship is typically obtained by birth in Canada or by birth or adoption abroad when at least one biological parent or adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen who was born in Canada or naturalized in Canada (and did not receive citizenship by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen). It can also be granted to a permanent resident who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements. Canada established its own nationality law in 1946 with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act which took effect on January 1, 1947. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 2001 as Bill C-11, which replaced the Immigration Act of 1976 as the primary federal legislation regulating immigration. Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship, Canada\\'s naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the Immigration Act of 1910.\\nAccording to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, there are three main classifications for immigrants: Family class (persons closely related to Canadian residents), Economic class (admitted on the basis of a point system that accounts for age, health and labour-market skills required for cost effectively inducting the immigrants into Canada\\'s labour market) and Refugee class (those seeking protection by applying to remain in the country by way of the Canadian immigration and refugee law). In 2008, there were 65,567 immigrants in the family class, 21,860 refugees, and 149,072 economic immigrants amongst the 247,243 total immigrants to the country. Canada resettles over one in 10 of the world\\u2019s refugees and has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world.\\nAs of a 2010 report by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, there were 2.8 million Canadian citizens abroad. This represents about 8% of the total Canadian population. Of those living abroad, the United States, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, China, and Lebanon have the largest Canadian diaspora. Canadians in the United States constitute the greatest single expatriate community at over 1 million in 2009, representing 35.8% of all Canadians abroad. Under current Canadian law, Canada does not restrict dual citizenship but Passport Canada encourages its citizens to travel abroad on their Canadian passport, so they can access Canadian consular services.\\n\\n\\n=== Ethnic ancestry ===\\n\\nCanada has 34 ethnic groups with at least 100,000 members each, of which 11 have over 1 million people and numerous others are represented in smaller amounts. According to the 2006 census, the largest self-reported ethnic origin is \"Canadian\" (32%), followed by English (21%), French (15.8%), Scottish (15.1%), Irish (13.9%), German (10.2%), Italian (4.6%), Chinese (4.3%), North American Indian (4.0%), Ukrainian (3.9%), and Dutch (Netherlands) (3.3%). In the 2006 census, over five million Canadians identified themselves as a member of a visible minority. Together, they make up 16.2% of the total population: most numerous among these are South Asian (4.0%), Black (2.5%), and Filipino (1.1%). Aboriginal peoples are not considered a visible minority under the Employment Equity Act, and this is the definition that Statistics Canada also uses.\\n\\nFor a complete list see: Canadian ethnic groups\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\n\\nCanada\\'s culture is a product of its ethnicities, languages, religions, political and legal system(s). Being a settler nation, Canada has been shaped by waves of migration that have combined to form a unique blend of art, cuisine, literature, humour and music. Today, Canada has a diverse makeup of nationalities and constitutional protection for policies that promote multiculturalism rather than cultural assimilation. In Quebec, cultural identity is strong, and many French-speaking commentators speak of a Quebec culture as distinguished from English Canadian culture. However, as a whole, Canada is a cultural mosaic: a collection of several regional, aboriginal, and ethnic subcultures.\\nCanadian government policies such as official bilingualism; publicly funded health care; higher and more progressive taxation; outlawing capital punishment; strong efforts to eliminate poverty; strict gun control; leniency in regard to drug use, and, most recently, legalizing same-sex marriage are social indicators of Canada\\'s political and cultural values. American media and entertainment are popular, if not dominant, in English Canada; conversely, many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the United States and worldwide. The Government of Canada has also influenced culture with programs, laws and institutions. It has created Crown corporations to promote Canadian culture through media and has also tried to protect Canadian culture by setting legal minimums on Canadian content.\\n\\nCanadian culture has historically been influenced by Aboriginal, French and British cultures and traditions. Most of Canada\\'s territory was inhabited and developed later than other European colonies in the Americas, with the result that themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, and traders were important in the early development of the Canadian identity. First Nations played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The British conquest of New France in the mid-1700s brought a large Francophone population under British Imperial rule, creating a need for compromise and accommodation. The new British rulers left alone much of the religious, political, and social culture of the French-speaking habitants, guaranteeing through the Quebec Act of 1774 the right of the Canadiens to practise the Catholic faith and to use French civil law (now Quebec law).\\nThe Constitution Act of 1867 was designed to meet the growing calls of Canadians for autonomy from British rule, while avoiding the overly strong decentralization that contributed to the Civil War in the United States. The compromises made by the Fathers of Confederation set Canadians on a path to bilingualism, and this in turn contributed to an acceptance of diversity.\\nThe Canadian Forces and overall civilian participation in the First World War and Second World War helped to foster Canadian nationalism, however in 1917 and 1944 conscription crisis\\' highlighted the considerable rift along ethnic lines between Anglophones and Francophones. As a result of the First and Second World Wars, the Government of Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority. With the gradual loosening of political ties to the United Kingdom and the modernization of Canadian immigration policies, 20th-century immigrants with African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture. The multiple-origins immigration pattern continues today with the arrival of large numbers of immigrants from non-British or non-French backgrounds.\\nMulticulturalism in Canada was adopted as the official policy of the government during the premiership of Pierre Elliot Trudeau in the 1970s and 1980s. The Canadian government has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration. Multiculturalism is administered by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and reflected in the law through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act and section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\n\\nCanada as a nation is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of groups, beliefs and customs. The preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms references \"God\", and the monarch carries the title of \"Defender of the Faith\". However Canada has no official religion, and support for religious pluralism (Freedom of religion in Canada) is an important part of Canada\\'s political culture. With Christianity on decline, having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life; commentators have suggested that Canada has come to enter a post-Christian period in a secular state, with irreligion in Canada on the rise. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and within the state.\\nThe 2011 Canadian census reported that 67.3% of Canadians identify as being Christians; of this number, Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7 percent of the population. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians); followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). About 23.9% of Canadians declare no religious affiliation, including agnostics, atheists, humanists, and other groups. The remaining are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which is Islam (3.2%), followed by Hinduism (1.5%), Sikhism (1.4%), Buddhism (1.1%), and Judaism (1.0%).\\nBefore the arrival of European colonists and explorers, First Nations followed a wide array of mostly animistic religions. During the colonial period, the French settled along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River, specifically Latin Rite Roman Catholics, including a number of Jesuits dedicated to converting Aboriginals; an effort that eventually proved successful. The first large Protestant communities were formed in the Maritimes after the British conquest of New France, followed by American Protestant settlers displaced by the American Revolution. The late nineteenth century saw the beginning of a substantive shift in Canadian immigration patterns. Large numbers of Irish and Southern Europeans immigrants were creating new Roman Catholic communities in English Canada. The settlement of the west brought significant Eastern Orthodox immigrants from Eastern Europe and Mormon and Pentecostal immigrants from the United States.\\nThe earliest documentation of Jewish presence in Canada occurs in the 1754 British Army records from the French and Indian War. In 1760, General Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst attacked and won Montreal for the British. In his regiment there were several Jews, including four among his officer corps, most notably Lieutenant Aaron Hart who is considered the father of Canadian Jewry. The Islamic, Sikh, Hindu and Buddhist communities, although small, are as old as the nation itself. The 1871 Canadian Census (first \"Canadian\" national census) indicated thirteen Muslims among the populace, with approximately 5000 Sikh by 1908. The first Canadian mosque was constructed in Edmonton, in 1938, when there were approximately 700 Muslims in Canada. Buddhism first arrived in Canada when Japanese immigrated during the late 19th century. The first Japanese Buddhist temple in Canada was built in Vancouver in 1905. The influx of immigrants in the late 20th century, with Sri Lankan, Japanese, Indian and Southeast Asian customs, has contributed to the recent expansion of the Sikh, Hindu and Buddhist communities.\\n\\n\\n=== Languages ===\\n\\nA multitude of languages are used by 35 million Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 60% and 20% of Canadians respectively. In 2011, nearly 6.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most common non-official first languages include Chinese (mainly Cantonese; 1,072,555 first-language speakers), Punjabi (430,705), Spanish (410,670), German (409,200), and Italian (407,490). Less than one percent of Canadians (just over 250,000 individuals) can speak an aboriginal language. About half this number (129,865) reported using an aboriginal language on a daily basis.\\nEnglish and French are recognized by the Constitution of Canada as official languages. Thus all federal government laws are enacted in both English and French with government services available in both languages. Two of Canada\\'s territories give official status to indigenous languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government. In the Northwest Territories, the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwich\\u2019in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and T\\u0142\\u012fch\\u01eb. Multicultural media are widely accessible across the county and offer specialty television channels, newspapers and other publications in many minority languages.\\nIn Canada, as elsewhere in the world of European colonies, the frontier of European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place, as cultures using different languages met and interacted. The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade, and (in some cases) intermarriage, led to the development of Mixed languages. Languages like Michif, Chinook Jargon and Bungi creole tended to be highly localized and were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nCanuck\\nDemographics of Canada\\nList of Canadians\\nPersons of National Historic Significance\\nList of Prime Ministers of Canada\\n Canada \\u2013 Wikipedia book\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nCanada Year Book 2010 - Statistics Canada\\nCanada: A People\\'s History - Teacher Resources - Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\\nPersons of National Historic Significance in Canada - Parks Canada\\nMulticultural Canada - Department of Canadian Heritage\\nThe Canadian Immigrant Experience - Library and Archives Canada\\nThe Dictionary of Canadian Biography \\u2013 Library and Archives Canada\\nCanadiana: The National Bibliography of Canada \\u2013 Library and Archives Canada', u'National Register of Historic Places listings in Peekskill, New York': u'This is a list of the National Register of Historic Places entries in Peekskill, New York.

The team finished in tenth place in the National League with a record of 55\\u201375, 35 games behind the Baltimore Orioles.\\n\\n\\n== Regular season ==\\nAfter a somewhat disappointing 1893 season, in which the Reds had a 65\\u201363 record to finish in sixth place, the club was hoping to rebound in 1894. Player-manager Charles Comiskey would return to manage the team for a third season. During the off-season, the Reds acquired outfielder Dummy Hoy from the Washington Senators in a trade. Hoy had batted .245 with no home runs, 45 RBI, and 48 stolen bases with the Senators in 1893. Hoy led the National League in stolen bases with 82 while with the Washington Nationals in 1888.\\nBug Holliday had a huge season for the Reds, hitting a team high .376 with a team record 123 RBI. He also hit thirteen home runs, which tied him with Jim Canavan, and had 126 runs. Canavan batted .275 and had 74 RBI to go with his thirteen homers. Hoy batted .304 with five home runs and 71 RBI while scoring 118 runs in his first season with Cincinnati. Bid McPhee hit .313 with five home runs and 93 RBI, while Arlie Latham also batted .313, hitting four home runs and collecting 60 RBI while stealing a team-high 62 bases.\\nThe Reds pitching staff struggled, as they had the worst ERA in the league at 5.99. Frank Dwyer led the team with a 19\\u201321 record with a team best 5.07 ERA in 45 games, 39 of them starts. Tom Parrott was 17\\u201319 with a 5.60 ERA in 41 games, while Ice Box Chamberlain was the only Cincinnati pitcher to have a winning record, as he was 10\\u20139 with a 5.77 ERA in 23 games.\\n\\n\\n=== Season summary ===\\nAfter opening the season with three wins, the Reds lost eight of their next ten to fall to a 5\\u20138 record and eighth place. Cincinnati responded with a four-game winning streak to bump themselves over .500, but fell into a slump and won only five of their next twenty-five games.\\nPitching was a problem, as during their slump, the team allowed over ten runs a game eight times, and twice allowed over twenty runs a game, which included a 20\\u201311 loss to the Boston Beaneaters, and a 21\\u20138 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. Cincinnati went on an eleven-game winning streak to close within three games of the .500 level, and broke over the .500 level with a 39\\u201338 record after winning eight in a row later in the season.\\nFrom that point on, however, the Reds were never a factor in the pennant race, as they were 16\\u201337 over their last 53 games to finish the year with a dreadful 55\\u201375 record, in tenth place, 35 games behind the Baltimore Orioles.\\n\\n\\n=== Season standings ===\\n\\n\\n=== Roster ===\\n\\n\\n== Player stats ==\\n\\n\\n=== Batting ===\\n\\n\\n==== Starters by position ====\\nNote: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\\n\\n\\n==== Other batters ====\\nNote: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\\n\\n\\n=== Pitching ===\\n\\n\\n==== Starting pitchers ====\\nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\\n\\n\\n==== Other pitchers ====\\nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\\n\\n\\n==== Relief pitchers ====\\nNote: G = Games pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; SV = Saves; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n1894 Cincinnati Reds season at Baseball Reference', u\"Chicago 'L'\": u'The Chicago \\u200a\\'\\u200bL\\u200a\\'\\u200b (sometimes written as \"L\" or \"el\", short for \"elevated\") is the rapid transit system serving the city of Chicago and some of its surrounding suburbs, in the U.S. state of Illinois. It is operated by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). It is the fourth largest rapid transit system in the United States in terms of total route length (at 102.8 miles (165.4 km) long), and the third busiest rail mass transit system in the United States after the New York City Subway and the Washington Metro. Chicago\\'s \\'L\\' provides 24-hour service on some portions of its network, being one of only four heavy rail rapid transit systems in the United States (the \\'L\\', New York City Subway, PATH, and Philadelphia\\'s PATCO Speedline) to do so. The oldest sections of the \\'L\\' started operations in 1892, making it the second-oldest rapid transit system in the Americas, after Boston\\'s \"T\". The \\'L\\' has been credited with fostering the growth of Chicago\\'s dense city core that is one of the city\\'s distinguishing features. The \\'L\\' consists of eight rapid transit lines laid out in a spoke-hub distribution paradigm mainly focusing transit towards the Loop. Although the \\'L\\' gained its nickname because large parts of the system are elevated, portions of the network are also in subway tunnels, at grade level, or open cut.\\nIn 2013 the \\'L\\' had an average of 726,459 passenger boardings each weekday, 456,993 each Saturday, and 328,553 each Sunday. In a 2005 poll, Chicago Tribune readers voted it one of the \"seven wonders of Chicago,\" behind the lakefront and Wrigley Field but ahead of Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), the Water Tower, the University of Chicago, and the Museum of Science and Industry.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe first \\'L\\', the Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad, began revenue service on June 6, 1892, when a small steam locomotive pulling four wooden coaches carrying a total of 27 men and 3 women departed the 39th Street station and arrived at the Congress Street Terminal 14 minutes later, over tracks that are still used by the Green Line. Over the next year service was extended to 63rd Street and Stony Island Avenue, then the Transportation Building of the World\\'s Columbian Exposition in Jackson Park.\\nIn 1893, trains began running on the Lake Street Elevated Railroad and in 1895 on the Metropolitan West Side Elevated, which had lines to Douglas Park, Garfield Park (since replaced), Humboldt Park (since demolished), and Logan Square. The Metropolitan was the United States\\' first non-exhibition rapid transit system powered by electric traction motors, a technology whose practicality had been demonstrated in 1890 on the \"intramural railway\" at the World Fair that had been held in Chicago. Two years later the South Side \\'L\\' introduced multiple-unit control, in which the operator can control all the motorized cars in a train, not just the lead unit. Electrification and MU control remain standard features of most of the world\\'s rapid transit systems.\\nA drawback of early \\'L\\' service was that none of the lines entered the central business district. Instead trains dropped passengers at stub terminals on the periphery due to a state law requiring approval by neighboring property owners for tracks built over public streets, something not easily obtained downtown. This obstacle was overcome by the legendary traction magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes, who went on to play a pivotal role in the development of the London Underground, and who was immortalized by Theodore Dreiser as the ruthless schemer Frank Cowperwood in The Titan (1914) and other novels. Yerkes, who controlled much of the city\\'s streetcar system, obtained the necessary signatures through cash and guile\\u2014at one point he secured a franchise to build a mile-long \\'L\\' over Van Buren Street from Wabash Avenue to Halsted Street, extracting the requisite majority from the pliable owners on the western half of the route, then building tracks chiefly over the eastern half, where property owners had opposed him. The Union Loop opened in 1897 and greatly increased the rapid transit system\\'s convenience. Operation on the Yerkes-owned Northwestern Elevated, which built the North Side \\'L\\' lines, began three years later, essentially completing the elevated infrastructure in the urban core although extensions and branches continued to be constructed in outlying areas through the 1920s.\\n\\nAfter 1911, the \\'L\\' lines came under the control of Samuel Insull, president of the Chicago Edison electric utility (now Commonwealth Edison), whose interest stemmed initially from the fact that the trains were the city\\'s largest consumer of electricity. Insull instituted many improvements, including free transfers and through routing, although he did not formally combine the original firms into the Chicago Rapid Transit Company until 1924. He also bought three other Chicago electrified railroads, the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad, Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad, and South Shore interurban lines, and ran the trains of the first two into downtown Chicago via the \\'L\\' tracks. This period of relative prosperity ended when Insull\\'s empire collapsed in 1932, but later in the decade the city with the help of the federal government accumulated sufficient funds to begin construction of two subway lines to supplement and, some hoped, permit eventual replacement of the Loop elevated. The construction of the Subway created the necessity to tunnel under the Chicago River and during that tunneling, there was at least one roof collapse that caused the river to pour in and drown at least one worker.\\nThe State Street Subway opened on October 17, 1943; the Dearborn Subway, on which work had been suspended during World War II, opened on February 25, 1951. The subways were constructed with a secondary purpose of serving as bomb shelters, as evidenced by the close spacing of the support columns (a more extensive plan proposed replacing the entire elevated system with subways). The subways bypassed a number of tight curves and circuitous routings on the original elevated lines (Milwaukee trains, for example, originated on Chicago\\'s northwest side but entered the Loop at the southwest corner), speeding service for many riders.\\n\\n\\n=== CTA assumes control ===\\nBy the 1940s the financial condition of the \\'L,\\' and of Chicago mass transit in general, had become too precarious to permit continued operation without subsidies, and the necessary steps were taken to enable a public takeover. In 1947, the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) acquired the assets of the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and the Chicago Surface Lines, operator of the city\\'s streetcars. Over the next few years CTA modernized the \\'L,\\' replacing antiquated wooden cars with new steel ones and closing lightly used branch lines and stations, many of which had been spaced only a quarter-mile apart.\\n\\nShortly after assuming control of the \\'L\\', CTA introduced an express service known as the A/B skip-stop service. Under this service, trains were designated as either \"A\" or \"B\" trains, and stations were alternately designated as \"A\" or \"B\", with heavily used stations designated as \"AB\". \"A\" trains would only stop at \"A\" or \"AB\" stations, and \"B\" trains would only stop at \"B\" or \"AB\" stations. The system was designed to speed up lines by having trains skip stations with fewer passengers while still allowing for frequent service at the heavily used \"AB\" stations. CTA first implemented A/B skip-stop service on the Lake Street Line (now part of the Green Line) in 1948, and the service proved effective as travel times were cut by a third. By the 1950s, the service was used throughout the system. All lines used the A/B skip-stop service between the 1950s and the 1990s with the exception of the Evanston and Skokie lines, which were too short to justify skip-stop service. Also, the Congress and Douglas branches of what later became the Blue Line were designated as \"A\" and \"B\" respectively, as were the Englewood (\"A\") and Jackson Park (\"B\") branches of what later became the Green Line, so individual stops were not skipped while trains were serving those branches. As time went by, the time periods which employed skip-stop service gradually decreased, as the waits at \"A\" and \"B\" stations became increasingly long during non-peak service. By the 1990s, use of the A/B skip-stop system was only justified during rush hour service. Another problem was that trains skipping stations to save time could not pass the train that was directly ahead, so skipping stations was not advantageous in all regards. In 1993, the CTA began to eliminate skip-stop service when it switched the southern branches of the Red and Green Lines. After this point, Green Line trains stopped at all stations, and Red Line trains stopped at all stations south of Harrison. The elimination of A/B skip-stop service continued with the opening of the all-stop Orange Line and the conversion of the Brown Line to all-stop service. On April 28, 1995, the A/B skip-stop system was completely eliminated with the transfer of the O\\'Hare branch of the Blue Line and the Howard branch of the Red Line to all-stop service. The removal of skip-stop service resulted in some slight increases in travel times on some parts of the system but greatly increased ridership at former \"A\" and \"B\" stations.\\nThe first air-conditioned cars were introduced in 1964, the last pre-World War II cars were retired in 1973, and new lines were built in expressway medians. The Congress branch, built in the median of the Eisenhower Expressway, replaced the Garfield Park \\'L\\' in 1958. The Dan Ryan branch opened on September 28, 1969, followed by an extension of the Milwaukee elevated into the Kennedy Expressway in 1970.\\n\\n\\n=== The \\'L\\' today ===\\n\\nAt 102.8 miles (165.4 km), the Chicago \\'L\\' is the fourth largest heavy rail rapid transit system in the United States in terms of route mileage. It runs over a total of 224.1 miles (360.7 km) of track. Ridership had been remarkably stable for nearly 40 years after the CTA takeover despite declining mass transit usage nationwide, with an average of 594,000 riders boarding each weekday in 1960 and 577,000 in 1985. Due to the Loop Flood in 1992, ridership was at 418,000 that year because CTA was forced to suspend operation for several weeks in the State and Dearborn subways, used by the most heavily traveled lines.\\nAlthough ridership is healthy and growth continues, it has not been uniformly distributed. Use of North Side lines is up, while that of West Side and South Side lines either remains stable or is seeing some declines. Ridership on the North Side Brown Line, for instance, has increased 83% since 1979, necessitating a station reconstruction project to accommodate longer trains.\\n\\nAnnual traffic on the Howard branch of the Red Line, which reached 38.7 million in 2010 and 40.9 million in 2011, has exceeded the 1927 prewar peak of 38.5 million. The section of the Blue Line between the Loop and Logan Square, which serves once-neglected but now bustling neighborhoods such as Wicker Park, Bucktown, and Palmer Square, has seen a 54% increase in weekday riders since 1992. On the other hand, weekday ridership on the South Side portion of the Green Line, which closed for two years for reconstruction starting in 1994, was 50,400 in 1978 but only 13,000 in 2006. Boardings at the 95th/Dan Ryan stop on the Red Line, though still the system\\'s busiest at 14,100 riders per weekday, are a little over half the peak volume in the 1980s. In 1976, three North Side \\'L\\' branches - what were then known as the Howard, Milwaukee, and Ravenswood lines \\u2212 accounted for 42% of non-downtown boardings. Today (with the help of the Blue Line extension to O\\'Hare), they account for 58%.\\nThe North Side (which has historically been the highest density area of the city) skew no doubt reflects the Chicago building boom between 2000 and 2010, which has focused primarily on North Side neighborhoods and downtown. It may ease somewhat in the wake of the current high level of residential construction along the south lakefront. For example, ridership at the linked Roosevelt stops on the Green, Orange, and Red Lines, which serve the burgeoning South Loop neighborhood, has tripled since 1992, with an average of 8,000 boardings per weekday. Patronage at the Cermak-Chinatown stop on the Red Line (4,000 weekday boardings) is at the highest level since the station opened in 1969. The 2003 Chicago Central Area Plan has proposed construction of a Green Line station at Cermak, midway between Chinatown and the McCormick Place convention center, in expectation of continued density growth in the vicinity.\\nAs of mid-2006, the \\'L\\' accounted for 36% of the CTA\\'s nearly 1.5 million weekday riders, with the remainder traveling on the extensive bus network. The rail system\\'s ridership has increased over time. In 1926, the year of peak prewar rail usage, the \\'L\\' carried 229 million passengers \\u2013 seemingly a formidable number, but actually less than 20% of the 1.16 billion Chicago transit patrons that year, most of whom rode the city\\'s streetcars. The shift to rail has continued in recent times. Since its low point in 1992 due to the Chicago Flood that closed subway tunnels in the downtown area, weekday \\'L\\' ridership has increased about 25%, while bus ridership has decreased by roughly a sixth.\\n\\n\\n== Renovation and expansion plans ==\\n\\nThe CTA\\'s current capital improvement spending is focused on the Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project, Slow Zone Elimination, and the rehabilitation of the Red Line. In 2012 the CTA reopened the Green Line\\'s Morgan station, and the Village of Skokie reopened the Yellow Line\\'s Oakton station. Both stations were closed in 1948 when the CTA was created, and the original stations were demolished soon after.\\nThe CTA is also actively studying a number of proposals for expanding \\'L\\' rail service, including the Circle Line and extensions to the Red, Orange, and Yellow Lines. The State\\'s capital budget proposal for fiscal year 2010 includes funding for \"preliminary engineering\" on the planned Circle Line, as well as funds for modernizing and replacing the system\\'s aging railcars.\\nIn addition, CTA has studied numerous other proposals for expanded rail service, some of which may be implemented in the future.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent service improvements ===\\n\\nPink Line service began on June 25, 2006, though it did not involve any new track or stations. The Pink Line travels over what was formerly a branch of the Blue Line from the 54/Cermak terminal in Cicero to the Polk-Medical Center station in Chicago. Pink Line trains then proceed via the Paulina Street Connector to the Lake Street branch of the Green Line and then clockwise around the Loop elevated via Lake-Wabash-Van Buren-Wells. (Douglas trains followed the same path between April 4, 1954 and June 22, 1958 after the old Garfield Park \\'L\\' line was demolished to make way for the Eisenhower Expressway.) The new route, which serves 23 stations, offers more frequent service for riders on both the Congress and Douglas branches. Pink Line trains can be scheduled independently of Blue Line trains, and run more frequently than the Douglas branch of the Blue Line did.\\n\\nThe Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project enabled CTA to run eight-car trains on the Brown Line, and rebuilt stations to modern standards, including handicap accessibility. Before the project, Brown Line platforms could only accommodate six-car trains, and increasing ridership led to uncomfortably crowded trains. After several years of construction, eight-car trains began to run at rush hour on the Brown Line in April 2008. The project was completed at the end of 2009, on time and on budget, with only minor punch list work remaining. The project\\u2019s total cost is expected to be around $530 million.\\nOne of the largest reconstruction projects in the CTA\\'s history, at a cost of $425 million, was the Red Line South reconstruction project. From May 19, 2013 through October 20, 2013, the project shut down and rebuilt the entire Red Line South \\u2014 replacing and rebuilding all the tracks, ties, ballast and drainage systems \\u2014 from Cermak-Chinatown to 95th/Dan Ryan.  The station work involved renewing and improving eight stations, including painting and lighting, bus bridge improvements, and new roofs and canopies at some stations. \"We are looking forward to providing our south Red Line customers with improved stations that are cleaner, brighter and better than they have been in years,\" said CTA President Forrest Claypool.\\n\\n\\n=== Current capital improvements ===\\nCTA\\u2019s Slow Zone Elimination Project continues. In late 2007, trains were forced to operate at reduced speed over more than 22% of the system due to deteriorated track, structure, and other problems. By October 2008, system-wide slow zones had been reduced to 9.1% and by January 2010, total slow zones were reduced to 6.3%. The Loop received track work in 2012-2013. The Purple Line in Evanston received track work and viaduct replacement in 2011-2013. The Green Line Ashland branch received track work in 2013, prior to the Red Line Dan Ryan reconstruction.\\nCurrently, the CTA is investing in station and track upgrades on the Blue Line between Grand and O\\'Hare. This 4 year, $492 million project, will result in modernized stations (some of which were originally built in 1895), rebuilt track, faster service between O\\'Hare and the Loop, station platform replacement, subway water management, subway station water infiltration remediation, and improved access to some stations (e.g. elevators).\\n\\n\\n=== Planning future projects ===\\nAll of the new rail service proposals under active consideration by CTA are currently undergoing Alternatives Analysis Studies.\\nThese studies are the first step in a five-step process. This process is required by the Federal New Starts program, which is an essential source of funding for CTA\\u2019s expansion projects. CTA uses a series of \"Screens\" to develop a \"Locally Preferred Alternative,\" which is submitted to the federal New Starts program.\\nIt will likely be years before any of these projects is completed, as no project yet has a definite source of funding.\\n\\n\\n==== Circle Line ====\\nThe proposed Circle Line would form an \"outer loop\", traversing downtown via the State Street subway, then going southwest on the Orange Line and north along Ashland, before re-joining the subway at North/Clybourn or Clark/Division. The Circle Line would connect several different Metra lines with the \\'L\\' system, and would facilitate transfers between existing CTA lines; these connections would be situated near the existing Metra and \\'L\\' lines\\' maximum load points. CTA intitiated official \"Alternatives Analysis\" planning for the Circle Line in 2005.\\nEarly conceptual planning divided the Circle Line into three segments. Phase 1 would be a restoration of the dilapidated \"Paulina Connector\", a short (0.75 mi/1.2 km) track segment that links Ashland/Lake with Polk. Phase 2 would link 18th on the Pink Line to Ashland on the Orange Line, with a new elevated structure running through a large industrial area. Phase 3, the final phase, would link Ashland/Lake to North/Clybourn with a new subway running through the dense neighborhoods of West Town and Logan Square. Although the general alignment of Phase 2 was decided upon at an early date, Phase 3 will run through dense residential areas, so the alignment must be considered carefully to avoid adversely impacting those neighborhoods. CTA continues to study various possibilities for the alignment of Phase 3.\\nPhase 1 was completed in 2005 with the restoration of the Paulina Connector. In 2006, the Connector was placed into service as part of the new Pink Line. In fall 2009, CTA released the results of its Alternatives Analysis Screen 3, in which it decided to begin early engineering work on Phase 2, due to its simple alignment through unpopulated areas and its relatively low cost (estimated at $1.1 billion). Phase 3, which CTA estimates will be far more costly due to its underground alignment, will remain under study until further notice.\\nPreliminary engineering work is now being performed on Phase 2. In addition to the new line, CTA plans to build four new stations as part of Phase 2, although three out of the four will be located along existing lines that the Circle Line will utilize. These will be at 18th/Clark, Cermak/Blue Island, Roosevelt/Paulina, and Congress/Paulina. 18th/Clark will be along the Orange Line in the Chinatown neighborhood, and will include a direct transfer connection to the Cermak/Chinatown station on the Red Line. Cermak/Blue Island will be located on the newly built elevated tracks in the Pilsen neighborhood. Roosevelt/Paulina will be located on the Pink Line in the Illinois Medical District. Finally, Congress/Paulina will be built above the Eisenhower Expressway, with a direct transfer connection to the Illinois Medical District station on the Blue Line. Existing stations will provide service near the United Center.\\n\\n\\n==== Line extensions ====\\nCTA is conducting Alternatives Analysis Studies of proposed extensions for the Red, Orange and Yellow Lines. Although these are three separate projects in three different areas of the city and suburbs, all three projects involve similar challenges of extending existing lines into underserved areas, so CTA has chosen to group the lines together into a larger program, so that analysis, engineering, and construction work can be done more cost-effectively through economies of scale.\\n\\n\\n===== Red Line extension =====\\nAn extension of the Red Line would provide service from the current terminus, at 95th Street, to 130th Street, decreasing transit times for residents of the far South Side and relieving crowding and congestion at the current terminus. CTA presented its locally preferred alternative at meetings in summer 2009. This consists of a new elevated rail line between 95th St and a new terminal station at 130th, paralleling a Union Pacific Railroad line through the Far South Side neighborhoods of Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale. In addition to the terminal station at 130th, three new stations would be built at 103rd Street, 111th Street, and 115th Street/Michigan Avenue. Basic engineering, along with an environmental impact statement, were underway in 2010.\\n\\n\\n===== Orange Line extension =====\\nAn extension of the Orange Line would provide transit service from the current terminus, Midway International Airport, to the Ford City Mall, which was originally meant to be the Orange Line\\'s southern terminus when the line was planned in the 1980s. This would alleviate congestion at the current Midway terminal. CTA presented its locally preferred alternative at meetings in summer 2009. This consists of a new elevated rail line that runs south from the Midway terminal along Belt Railway tracks, crosses Clearing Yard while heading southwest to Cicero Avenue, then runs south in the median of Cicero to a terminal on the east side of Cicero near 76th Street. Basic engineering, along with an environmental impact statement, were underway in 2010.\\n\\n\\n===== Yellow Line extension =====\\nAn extension of the Yellow Line would provide transit service from the current terminus, at Dempster Street, to the corner of Old Orchard Road and the Edens Expressway, just west of the Westfield Old Orchard shopping center. CTA presented its locally preferred alternative at meetings in summer 2009. This consists of a new elevated rail line from Dempster north along a former rail right-of-way to the Edens Expressway, where the line will turn to the north and run along the east side of the expressway to a terminus at Old Orchard Road. Basic engineering, along with an environmental impact statement, were underway in 2010. Unlike extensions to the Red and Orange Lines, the Yellow Line Extension has attracted significant community opposition from residents of Skokie, as well as parents of students at neighboring Niles North High School, on whose land the new line would be constructed. Residents and parents have cited concerns about noise, visual pollution, and crime. It is expected that these concerns will be addressed in the environmental impact statement.\\n\\n\\n=== Possible future projects ===\\nThere are other possible future expansions, identified in various city and regional planning studies. CTA has not begun official studies of these expansions, so it is unclear whether they will ever be implemented, or simply remain as visionary projects. They include:\\nClinton Street Subway, running through the West Loop, connecting the Red Line near North/Clybourn to the Red Line again, near Cermak-Chinatown. From North/Clybourn, the subway would run south along Larrabee Street, then under the Chicago River to Clinton Street in the West Loop. Running south under Clinton, the subway would pass Ogilvie Transportation Center and Union Station, with short connections to Metra trains. It would then continue south on Clinton until roughly 16th Street, where it would turn east, cross the river again, and rejoin the Red Line just north of the current Cermak-Chinatown stop. The estimated cost of this line was $3 billion, with no local funding source identified.\\nAirport Express service to O\\'Hare International Airport and Midway from a downtown terminal on State Street. On the 3200 series cars, black Midway and O\\'Hare destination signs exist, suggesting a possible Airport Express service, since the sign used for Express trains is written in a black background. A business plan prepared for CTA called for a private firm to manage the venture with service starting in 2008. The project has been criticized as a boondoggle. The custom-equipped, premium-fare trains would offer nonstop service at faster speeds than the current Blue and Orange Lines. Although the trains would not run on dedicated rails (construction of such tracks could cost more than $1.5 billion), several short sections of passing track built at stations would allow the express trains to pass Blue and Orange trains while they sit at those stations. CTA has pledged $130 million and the city of Chicago $42 million toward the cost of the downtown station. In comments posted to her blog in 2006, CTA chair Carole Brown said, \"I would support premium rail service only if it brought significant new operating dollars, capital funding, or other efficiencies to CTA \\u2026 The most compelling reason to proceed with the project is the opportunity to connect the Blue and Red subway tunnels,\" which are one block apart downtown. In the meantime, CTA announced that due to cost overruns, it would only complete the shell of the Block 37 station; its president said \"it would not make sense to completely build out the station or create the final tunnel connections until a partner is selected because final layout, technology and finishes are dependent on an operating plan.\"\\nMid-City Transitway running around, rather than through the Chicago Loop. The line would follow the Cicero Avenue/Belt Line corridor (former Crosstown Expressway alignment) between the O\\'Hare branch of the Blue Line at Montrose and the Dan Ryan branch of the Red Line at 87th Street. It may be an \\'L\\' line, but busway and other options are being considered.\\n\\nNumerous plans have been advanced over the years to reorganize downtown Chicago rapid transit service, originally with the intention of replacing the Loop lines that are elevated with subways. That idea has been largely abandoned as the city seems keen on keeping an elevated/subway mix. But there have been continued calls to improve transit within the city\\'s greatly enlarged central core. At present the \\'L\\' does not provide direct service between the Metra commuter rail terminals in the West Loop and Michigan Avenue, the principal shopping district, nor does it offer convenient access to popular downtown destinations such as Navy Pier, Soldier Field, and McCormick Place. Plans for the Central Area Circulator, a $700 million downtown light rail system meant to remedy this, were shelved in 1995 for lack of funding. An underground line running along the lakeshore would connect some of the city\\'s major tourist destinations, but this plan has not been widely discussed. Recognizing the cost and difficulty of implementing an all-rail solution, the Chicago Central Area Plan advocated a mix of rail and bus improvements, the centerpiece of which was the West Loop Transportation Center, a multi-level subway to be constructed under Clinton Street from Congress Parkway to Lake Street. The top level would be a pedestrian mezzanine, buses would operate in the second level, rapid transit trains in the third level, and commuter/high-speed intercity trains in the bottom level. The rapid transit level would connect to the existing Blue Line subway at its north and south ends, making possible the \"Blue Line loop,\" envisioned as an underground counterpart to the Loop elevated. Alternatively, this level might be occupied by the Clinton Street Subway. Among other advantages, the West Loop Transportation Center would provide a direct link between the \\'L\\' and the city\\'s two busiest commuter rail terminals, Ogilvie Transportation Center and Union Station. The plan also proposed transitways along Carroll Avenue (a former rail right-of-way north of the main branch of the Chicago River) and under Monroe Street in the Loop, which earlier transit schemes had proposed as rail routes. The Carroll Avenue route would provide faster bus service between the commuter stations and the rapidly redeveloping Near North Side, with possible rail service later. These new busways would tie into the bus level of the West Loop Transportation Center.\\n\\n\\n== Lines ==\\n\\nSince 1993 \\'L\\' lines have been officially identified by color, although older route names survive to some extent in CTA publications and popular usage to distinguish branches of longer lines:\\n     Red Line, consisting of the Howard, State Street Subway and Dan Ryan branches\\nThe Red Line is the busiest route, with 234,232 passenger boardings on an average weekday in 2013. It includes 33 stations on its 21.8-mile (35 km) route, traveling from Howard Street terminal on the city\\'s northern border with Evanston, through downtown Chicago via the State Street subway, then down the Dan Ryan Expressway median to 95th Street on the South Side. Despite its length, the Red Line stops five miles short of the city\\'s southern border. Extension plans to 130th are currently being considered. The Red Line is one of two lines operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is the only transit line that goes near both Wrigley Field and U.S. Cellular Field, the homes of Chicago\\'s Major League Baseball teams, the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox respectively.\\n     Blue Line, consisting of the O\\'Hare, Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway, and Congress branches.\\nThe Blue Line extends from O\\'Hare International Airport through the Loop via the Milwaukee-Dearborn subway to the West Side. Trains travel to Des Plaines Avenue in Forest Park via the Eisenhower Expressway median. The route from O\\'Hare to Des Plaines Avenue is 26.93 miles (43 km) long. The combined number of stations is 33. Until 1970 the northern section of the Blue Line terminated at Logan Square, during that time it was called the Milwaukee route after Milwaukee Avenue which ran parallel to it; in that year service was extended to Jefferson Park via the Kennedy Expressway median, and in 1984 to O\\'Hare. The Blue Line is the second-busiest, with 176,120 weekday boardings. It operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\\n     Brown Line, or Ravenswood Line\\nThe Brown Line follows an 11.4-mile (18 km) route, with 19 stations between Kimball Avenue in Albany Park and the Loop in downtown Chicago. In 2013, the Brown Line had an average weekday ridership of 108,529.\\n     Green Line, consisting of the Lake Street Elevated, South Side Main Line, Ashland and East 63rd branches\\nA completely elevated route utilizing the system\\'s oldest segments (dating back to 1892), the Green Line extends 20.8 miles (33.5 km) with 29 stops between Forest Park and Oak Park (Harlem/Lake), through The Loop , to the South Side. South of the Garfield station the line branches, with trains alternately heading to Ashland/63rd in Englewood and Cottage Grove/63rd in Woodlawn. The East 63rd branch formerly extended to Jackson Park, but the portion east of Cottage Grove, which ran above 63rd Street, was demolished in the 1980s and 1997 due to structural problems and then replaced due to community demands. The average number of weekday boardings in 2013 was 68,230.\\n     Orange Line or Midway Line\\nThe 13-mile (21 km) long Orange Line was constructed in the early 1990s on existing railroad embankments and new concrete and steel elevated structure. It runs from a station adjacent to Chicago Midway International Airport on the Southwest Side to The Loop in downtown Chicago. Average weekday ridership in 2013 was 58,765.\\n     Purple Line, consisting of the Evanston Shuttle and Evanston Express\\nThe Purple Line is a 3.9-mile (6 km) branch serving north suburban Evanston and Wilmette with express service to the Loop during weekday rush hours. The local service operates from the Wilmette terminal at Linden Avenue through Evanston to the Howard Street terminal where it connects with the Red and Yellow lines. The weekday rush hour express service continues from Howard to the Loop, running nonstop on the four-track line used by the Red Line to Belmont station, then serving all Brown Line stops to the Loop. 2013 average weekday ridership was 42,673 passenger boardings. The stops from Belmont to Chicago Avenue were added in the 1990s to relieve crowding on the Red and Brown lines. The name \"purple line\" is a reference to nearby Northwestern University, with four stops (Davis, Foster, Noyes, and Central) located just two blocks west of the University campus.\\n     Pink Line consisting of the Douglas Branch and Paulina Connector\\nThe Pink Line is a 11.2-mile (18 km) rerouting of former Blue Line Douglas Park branch trains from 54th/Cermak in Cicero via the previously non-revenue Paulina Connector and the Green Line on Lake Street to the Loop. Its average weekday ridership in 2013 was 31,572. While still an extension of the original Douglas Park branch, the line ran to Oak Park Avenue in Berwyn, four miles west of its current terminal point. In 1952 service on the portion of the line past 54th Avenue was shut down and over the next decade the stations were dismantled and the tracks were either pulled up or paved over. The street level right-of-way is used to this day as a miles-long parking lot, locally known as the \" \\'L\\' Strip\".\\n     Yellow Line, or Skokie Swift\\nThe Yellow Line is a 4.7-mile (8 km) three station line that runs from the Howard Street terminal to Skokie terminal in suburban Skokie. The Yellow Line is the only \\'L\\' route that does not provide direct service to the Loop. This line was originally part of the North Shore Line\\'s interurban rail service, and was acquired by the CTA in the 1960s. The Yellow Line previously operated as a nonstop shuttle, until the downtown Skokie station Oakton\\u2013Skokie opened on April 30, 2012. Other plans in consideration are to extend the line from its current Dempster Street terminus to Old Orchard via an elevated right of way and the construction of an infill station in Evanston. Its average weekday ridership in 2013 was 6,338 passenger boardings.\\nThe Loop\\nBrown, Green, Orange, Pink, and Purple Line Express trains serve downtown Chicago via the Loop elevated. The Loop\\'s nine stations average 72,843 weekday boardings.\\nThe Orange Line, Purple Line and the Pink Line run clockwise, the Brown Line runs counter-clockwise. The Green Line is the Loop\\'s only through service; the other four lines circle the Loop and return to their starting points. The Loop forms a rectangle roughly 0.4 miles (650 m long) east-to-west and 0.6 miles (960 m) long north-to-south. The loop crossing at Lake and Wells has been described in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world\\'s busiest railroad crossing.\\n\\n\\n== Rolling stock ==\\n\\nThe CTA operates over 1,350 \\'L\\' cars, divided among three series, some of which are permanently coupled into married pairs. During operation hours, 986 of these cars are used. All cars on the system utilize 600 volt direct current power delivered through a third rail. The new 5000-series cars are equipped with alternating current propulsion systems and have inverters on board to convert the DC power to AC power. The older cars use DC motors.\\n\\nThe 2600-series was built between 1981 and 1987 by the Budd Company. At the completion of the order of the 2600-series cars, Budd changed its name to TransitAmerica and ceased production of railcars. With 565 cars in operation, the 2600-series is the largest of the five series of \\'L\\' cars in operation.\\n\\nThe 3200-series, was built between 1992 and 1994 by Morrison-Knudsen. These cars have fluted, stainless steel sides similar to the now-retired 2200-series.\\nThe newest series of train cars, the 5000-series, feature AC propulsion, security cameras, and aisle-facing seating.\\n\\n\\n== Nickname ==\\nThe Chicago rapid-transit system is officially nicknamed the \\'L\\'. This name for the CTA rail system applies to the whole system: its elevated, subway, at-grade, and open-cut segments. The use of the nickname dates from the earliest days of the elevated railroads. Newspapers of the late 1880s referred to proposed elevated railroads in Chicago as \\'\"L\" roads.\\' The first route to be constructed, the Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad gained the nickname \"Alley Elevated\", or \"Alley L\" during its planning and construction, a term that was widely used by 1893, less than a year after the line opened.\\nIn discussing various stylings of \"Loop\" and \"L\" in Destination Loop: The Story of Rapid Transit Railroading in and around Chicago (1982), author Brian J. Cudahy quotes a passage from The Neon Wilderness (1949) by Chicago author Nelson Algren: \"beneath the curved steel of the El, beneath the endless ties.\" Cudahy then comments, \"Note that in the quotation above ... it says \\'El\\' to mean \\'elevated rapid transit railroad.\\' We trust that this usage can be ascribed to a publisher\\'s editor in New York or some other east coast city; in Chicago the same expression is routinely rendered \\'L.\\'\" The Chicago Tribune style guide also uses \\'L.\\'\\nAs used by CTA, the name is rendered as the capital letter \\'L\\', in quotation marks. \"L\" (with double quotation marks) was often used by CTA predecessors such as the Chicago Rapid Transit Company; however, the CTA uses single quotation marks (\\') on some printed materials and signs rather than double. In Chicago, the term \\'subway\\' is only applied to the sections of the \\'L\\' network that are actually underground and is not applied to the entire system as a whole, as in New York City where both the elevated and underground portions are called the subway.\\n\\n\\n== Security and safety ==\\nThe CTA rail cars have generally been secure and safe but in addition to general security issues on the CTA, there were calls to improve CTA\\'s emergency response and communications procedures. CTA has also had incidents where operators apparently overrode automatic train stops on red signals, such as the 1977 collision at Wabash and Lake, when 4 cars of a Lake-Dan Ryan train fell from the elevated structure, killing 11, and two minor incidents in 2001, and two more in 2008, the more serious involving a Green Line train that derailed and straddled the split in the elevated structure at the 59th Street junction between the Ashland and East 63rd Street branches, and a minor one near 95th Street on the Red line.\\nIn 2002, 25-year-old Joseph Konopka, self-styled as \"Dr. Chaos\", was arrested by Chicago police for hoarding potassium cyanide and sodium cyanide in a Chicago Transit Authority storeroom in the Chicago \\'L\\' Blue Line subway. Konopka had picked the original locks on several doors in the tunnels, then changed the locks so that he could access the rarely used storage rooms freely.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nMovies and television shows use establishing shots to orient audiences to location. For media set in Chicago, the \\'L\\' is a common feature because it is such a distinctive part of the city. Some of the more prominent films which have used such setup footage include The Fugitive (1993), which also included a short scene inside of an \\'L\\' train, The Sting (1973), and The Blues Brothers (1980). Running Scared (1986) shows a car chase taking place on the \\'L\\' tracks. The sounds of the \\'L\\' are also distinctive and thus also used to establish location. Risky Business (1983) features the \\'L\\' in several erotic sequences. The \\'L\\' is also featured in Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987) and Code of Silence (1985). The line is part of the main plot device in While You Were Sleeping (1995) where Lucy works as an \\'L\\' fare collector.\\nThe \\'L\\' is referenced in Lynda Hull\\'s poem Black Mare, published in 1990 in her book Star Ledger. It also appears in the credit sequence for the television shows The Bob Newhart Show, ER, and Good Times.\\nIn the video game Watch Dogs (set in Chicago), the \\'L\\' is a method of transportation within the in-game rendition of the city. It can also be controlled by the main protagonist, Aiden Pierce, using his smartphone.\\nIt is also seen in the 2014 movie Divergent.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of metro systems\\nTransportation in Chicago\\nList of United States rapid transit systems by ridership\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nCudahy, Brian J.

It includes both non-volcanic mountains, such as the North Cascades, and the notable volcanoes known as the High Cascades. The small part of the range in British Columbia is referred to as the Canadian Cascades or, locally, as the Cascade Mountains. The latter term is also sometimes used by Washington residents to refer to the Washington section of the Cascades in addition to North Cascades, the more usual U.S. term, as in North Cascades National Park. The highest peak in the range is Mount Rainier in Washington at 14,411 feet (4,392 m).\\nThe Cascades are part of the Pacific Ocean\\'s Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Ocean. All of the eruptions in the contiguous United States over the last 200 years have been from Cascade volcanoes. The two most recent were Lassen Peak from 1914 to 1921 and a major eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. Minor eruptions of Mount St. Helens have also occurred since, most recently in 2005.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\nThe Cascades extend northward from Lassen Peak (also known as Mount Lassen) in northern California to the confluence of the Nicola and Thompson rivers in British Columbia. The Fraser River separates the Cascades from the Coast Mountains. The highest volcanoes of the Cascades, known as the High Cascades, dominate their surroundings, often standing twice the height of the nearby mountains. They often have a visual height (height above nearby crestlines) of one mile or more. The highest peaks, such as the 14,411-foot (4,392 m) Mount Rainier, dominate their surroundings for 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km).\\nThe northern part of the range, north of Mount Rainier, is known as the North Cascades in the United States but is formally named the Cascade Mountains north of the Canada \\u2013 United States border, reaching to the northern extremity of the Cascades at Lytton Mountain. Overall, the North Cascades and Canadian Cascades are extremely rugged; even the lesser peaks are steep and glaciated, and valleys are quite low relative to peaks and ridges, so there is great local relief. The southern part of the Canadian Cascades, particularly the Skagit Range, is geologically and topographically similar to the North Cascades, while the northern and northeastern parts are less glaciated and more plateau-like, resembling nearby areas of the Thompson Plateau.\\nBecause of the range\\'s proximity to the Pacific Ocean and the region\\'s prevailing westerly winds, precipitation is substantial, especially on the western slopes due to orographic lift, with annual snow accumulations of up to 1,000 inches (25,000 mm) in some areas. For example, Mount Baker in Washington recorded a world-record single-season snowfall in the winter of 1998\\u201399 with 1,140 inches (29,000 mm). Prior to that year, Mount Rainier held the world record for snow accumulation at Paradise in 1978. It is not uncommon for some places in the Cascades to have over 500 inches (13,000 mm) of annual snow accumulation, such as at Lake Helen, near Lassen Peak. Most of the High Cascades are therefore white with snow and ice year-round. The western slopes are densely covered with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and red alder (Alnus rubra), while the drier eastern slopes feature mostly ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), with some western larch (Larix occidentalis), and subalpine fir (Tsuga mertensiana) and alpine larch (Larix lyallii) at higher elevations. Annual rainfall is as low as 9 inches (230 mm) on the eastern foothills due to a rain shadow effect.\\nBeyond the eastern foothills is an arid plateau that was largely created 17 to 14 million years ago by the many flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Together, these sequences of fluid volcanic rock form the 200,000-square-mile (520,000 km2) Columbia Plateau in eastern Washington, Oregon, and parts of western Idaho.\\n\\nThe Columbia River Gorge is the only major break of the range in the United States. When the Cascades started to rise 7 million years ago in the Pliocene, the Columbia River drained the relatively low Columbia Plateau. As the range grew, erosion from the Columbia River was able to keep pace, creating the gorge and major pass seen today. The gorge also exposes uplifted and warped layers of basalt from the plateau.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nIn early 1792 British navigator George Vancouver explored Puget Sound and gave English names to the high mountains he saw. Mount Baker was named for Vancouver\\'s third lieutenant, Joseph Baker, although the first European to see it was Manuel Quimper, who named it \"La gran Monta\\xf1a del Carmelo\" in 1790. Mount Rainier was named after Admiral Peter Rainier. Later in 1792 Vancouver had his lieutenant William Robert Broughton explore the lower Columbia River. He named Mount Hood after Lord Samuel Hood, an admiral of the Royal Navy. Mount St. Helens was sighted by Vancouver in May 1792, from near the mouth of the Columbia River. It was named for Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens, a British diplomat. Vancouver\\'s expedition did not, however, name the mountain range which contained these peaks. He referred to it simply as the \"eastern snowy range\". Earlier Spanish explorers called it sierra nevadas, meaning \"snowy mountains\".\\nIn 1805 the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the Cascades on the Columbia River, which for many years was the only practical way to pass that part of the range. They were the first non-indigenous people to see Mount Adams, but they thought it was Mount St. Helens. When they later saw Mount St. Helens they thought it was Mount Rainier. On their return trip Lewis and Clark spotted a high but distant snowy pinnacle that they named for the sponsor of the expedition, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson. Lewis and Clark called the Cascade Range the \"Western Mountains\".\\n\\nThe Lewis and Clark expedition, and the many settlers and traders that followed, met their last obstacle to their journey at the Cascades Rapids in the Columbia River Gorge, a feature on the river now submerged beneath the Bonneville Reservoir. Before long, the great white-capped mountains that loomed above the rapids were called the \"mountains by the cascades\" and later simply as the \"Cascades\". The earliest attested use of the name \"Cascade Range\" is in the writings of botanist David Douglas.\\nIn 1814 Alexander Ross, a fur trader with the North West Company, seeking a viable route across the mountains, explored and crossed the northern Cascades between Fort Okanogan and Puget Sound. His report of the journey is vague about the route taken. He followed the lower Methow River into the mountains. He might have used Cascade Pass to reach the Skagit River. Ross was the first European-American to explore the Methow River area and likely the first to explore the Stehekin River and Bridge Creek region. Due to the difficulty of crossing the northern Cascades and the paucity of beaver, fur-trading companies made only a few explorations into the mountains north of the Columbia River after Ross.\\nExploration and settlement of the Cascades region by Europeans and Americans was accelerated by the establishment of a major trading post of the Hudson\\'s Bay Company (HBC) at Fort Vancouver near today\\'s Portland, Oregon. From this base HBC trapping parties traveled throughout the Cascades in search of beaver and other fur-bearing animals. For example, using what became known as the Siskiyou Trail, Hudson\\'s Bay Company trappers were the first non-natives to explore the southern Cascades in the 1820s and 1830s, establishing trails which passed near Crater Lake, Mount McLoughlin, Medicine Lake Volcano, Mount Shasta, and Lassen Peak.\\n\\nThe course of political history in the Pacific Northwest saw the spine of the Cascade Range being proposed as a boundary settlement during the Oregon Dispute of 1846. The United States rejected the proposal and insisted on the 49th parallel north, which cuts across the range just north of Mount Baker. Throughout the period of dispute and up to the creation of the Crown Colony of British Columbia in 1858, the Hudson\\'s Bay Company\\'s York Factory Express route, as well the route of fur brigades, followed the Okanogan River along the east edge of the Cascades and the Columbia River through the range. Passes across the range were not well known and little used. Naches Pass was used for driving cattle and horses to Fort Nisqually. Yakima Pass was also used by the Hudson\\'s Bay Company.\\n\\nAmerican settlement of the flanks of the Coast Range did not occur until the early 1840s, at first only marginally. Following the Oregon Treaty the inward flux of migration from the Oregon Trail intensified and the passes and back-valleys of what is now the state of Washington were explored and populated, and it was not long after that railways followed. Despite its being traversed by several major freeways and rail lines, and its lower flanks subjected to major logging in recent decades, large parts of the range remain intense and forbidding alpine wilderness. Much of the northern half of the Cascades, from Rainier north, have been preserved by U.S. national or British Columbia provincial parks (such as E.C. Manning Provincial Park), or other forms of protected area.\\nThe Canadian side of the range has a history that includes the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858\\u201360 and its famous Cariboo Road, as well as the older Hudson\\'s Bay Company Brigade Trail from the Canyon to the Interior, the Dewdney Trail, and older routes which connected east to the Similkameen and Okanagan valleys.\\n\\nThe southern mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway penetrated the range via the passes of the Coquihalla River, along one of the steepest and snowiest routes in the entire Pacific Cordillera. Near Hope, B.C., the railway roadbed and the Othello Tunnels, now decommissioned, are popular tourist recreation destinations for hiking and bicycling. The pass is used by the Coquihalla Highway, a government megaproject built as part of the Expo 86 spending boom of the 1980s, which is now the main route from the Coast to the British Columbia interior. Traffic formerly went via the Fraser Canyon, to the west, or via Allison Pass and Manning Park along Highway 3 to the south, near the border.\\nThe Barlow Road was the first established land path for U.S. settlers through the Cascade Range in 1845, and formed the final overland link for the Oregon Trail (previously, settlers had to raft down the treacherous rapids of the Columbia River). The Barlow Road left the Columbia at Hood River and passed along the south side of Mount Hood at Government Camp, terminating in Oregon City. There is an interpretive site there now at \"The End of The Oregon Trail.\" The road was constructed as a toll road \\u2014 $5 per wagon \\u2014 and was very successful.\\nIn addition, the Applegate Trail was created to allow settlers to avoid rafting down the Columbia River. The Applegate Trail used the path of the California Trail to north-central Nevada. From there, the Applegate Trail headed northwest into northern California, and continued northwest towards today\\'s Ashland, Oregon. From there, settlers would head north along the established Siskiyou Trail into the Willamette Valley.\\nWith the exception of the 1915 eruption of remote Lassen Peak in Northern California, the range was quiet for more than a century. Then, on May 18, 1980, the dramatic eruption of little-known Mount St. Helens shattered the quiet and brought the world\\'s attention to the range. Geologists were also concerned that the St. Helens eruption was a sign that long-dormant Cascade volcanoes might become active once more, as in the period from 1800 to 1857 when a total of eight erupted. None have erupted since St. Helens, but precautions are being taken nevertheless, such as the Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System in Pierce County, Washington.\\n\\n\\n== Geology ==\\n\\nThe Cascades contain active volcanoes, including Mount St. Helens, and several dormant volcanoes including Mount Rainier and Mount Baker. The tectonics of the region has been extensively studied to help describe the extent of the shifting and volcanic problems.\\n\\n\\n== Human uses and legends ==\\nSoil conditions for farming are generally good, especially downwind of volcanoes. This is largely because volcanic rocks are often rich in potassium bearing minerals such as orthoclase and decay easily. Volcanic debris, especially lahars, also have a leveling effect and the storage of water in the form of snow and ice is also important. These snow-capped mountains such as Mt. Hood and Mt. Bachelor are used as ski resorts in the late winter. Much of that water eventually flows into reservoirs, where it is used for recreation before its potential energy is captured to generate hydroelectric power before being used to irrigate crops.\\nBecause of the abundance of powerful streams, many of the major westward rivers off the Cascades have been dammed to provide hydroelectric power. One of these, Ross Dam on the Skagit River, created a reservoir which spans the border southeast of Hope, British Columbia, extending 2 miles (3.2 km) into Canada. At the foot of the southeast flank of Mount Baker, at Concrete, Washington, the Baker River is dammed to form Lake Shannon and Baker Lake.\\nIn addition, there is a largely untapped amount of geothermal power that can be generated from the Cascades. The U.S. Geological Survey Geothermal Research Program has been investigating this potential. Some of this energy is already being used in places like Klamath Falls, Oregon, where volcanic steam is used to heat public buildings. The highest recorded temperature found in the range is 510 \\xb0F (266 \\xb0C) at 3,075 feet (937 m) below Newberry Volcano\\'s caldera floor.\\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the area for thousands of years and developed their own myths and legends about the Cascades. In these legends, St. Helens with its pre-1980 graceful appearance, was regarded as a beautiful maiden for whom Hood and Adams feuded. Native tribes also developed their own names for the High Cascades and many of the smaller peaks, including \"Tahoma\", the Lushootseed name for Mount Rainier; and \"Louwala-Clough\", meaning \"smoking mountain\" for Mount St. Helens.\\n\\n\\n== Ecology ==\\n\\nThere is a wide range of flora and fauna inhabiting the Cascade Range. The ecology of the area can be understood by following a west-to-east line. As the line passes through the Cascade Range, it crosses a number of ecoregions, first getting higher and colder, then getting warmer, yet drier. Most of the Cascades\\' lower and middle elevations are covered in coniferous forest; the higher altitudes have extensive meadows as well as alpine tundra and glaciers. Common trees include Western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). The southern part of the Cascades are within the California Floristic Province, an area of high biodiversity.\\nBlack bears, coyotes, bobcats, cougars, beavers, deer, elk, moose and a few wolf packs returning from Canada live in the Cascades. Fewer than 50 grizzly bears reside in the Cascades of Canada and Washington.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCascadia (independence movement)\\nCascadia subduction zone\\nGeology of the Pacific Northwest\\nList of mountain ranges in Washington\\nList of Cascade Range topics\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nCentral and Southern Cascades Forests images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu\\nEastern Cascades Forests images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu\\nCascade Mountains Leeward Forests images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu\\nBritish Columbia Mainland Coastal Forests images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu\\nUniversity of Washington Libraries Digital Collections \\u2013 Dwight Watson Photographs', u'Channel Islands of California': u'The Channel Islands of California are a chain of eight islands located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California along the Santa Barbara Channel in the United States of America. Five of the islands are part of Channel Islands National Park, and the waters surrounding these islands make up Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\nThe eight islands are split among the jurisdictions of three separate California counties: Santa Barbara County (four), Ventura County (two), and Los Angeles County (two). The islands are divided into two groups\\u2014the Northern Channel Islands and the Southern Channel Islands. The four Northern Islands used to be a single landmass known as Santa Rosae.\\nThe archipelago extends for 160 miles (257.51 kilometers) between San Miguel Island in the north and San Clemente Island in the south. Together, the islands\\u2019 land area totals 221,331 acres (89,569 ha), or about 346 square miles (900 km2).\\nFive of the islands (San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and Santa Barbara) were made into the Channel Islands National Park in 1980. The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary encompasses the waters six nautical miles (11 kilometers) off Anacapa, Santa Cruz, San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Barbara islands.\\nSanta Catalina Island is the only one of the eight islands with a significant permanent civilian settlement\\u2014the resort city of Avalon, California, and the unincorporated town of Two Harbors.\\nNatural seepage of oil occurs at several places in the Santa Barbara Channel. Tar balls or pieces of tar in small numbers are found in the kelp and on the beaches. Native Americans used naturally occurring tar, bitumen, for a variety of purposes which include roofing, waterproofing, paving and some ceremonial purposes.\\nThe Channel Islands at low elevations are virtually frost-free and constitute one of the few such areas in the 48 contiguous US states. It snows only rarely, on higher mountain peaks.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nSeparated from the California mainland throughout recent geological history, the Channel Islands provide the earliest evidence for human seafaring in the Americas. It is also the site of the discovery of the earliest paleontological evidence of humans in North America. The Northern Channel Islands are now known to have been settled by maritime Paleo Indian peoples at least 13,000 years ago. Archaeological sites on the island provide a unique and invaluable record of human interaction with Channel Island marine and terrestrial ecosystems from the late Pleistocene to historic times. Historically, the northern islands were occupied by the Island Chumash, while the southern islands were occupied by the Tongva. San Nicolas has had a book written about the indigenous peoples living on the island, Island of the Blue Dolphins.\\nThe Chumash and Tongva were removed from the islands in the early 19th century, taken to Spanish missions and pueblos on the adjacent mainland. For a century, the Channel Islands were used primarily for ranching and fishing activities, which had significant impacts on island ecosystems, including the local extinction of sea otters, bald eagles, and other species. With most of the Channel Islands now managed by federal agencies or conservation groups, the restoration of the island ecosystems has made significant progress.\\nIn 1972, the Brown Berets seized and claimed the islands for Mexico, citing the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, a treaty between Mexico and the USA by which Mexico lost more than half of its territory, and arguing that the treaty does not specifically mention the Channel Islands nor the Farallon Islands. Though the United States had occupied them since 1852, the group speculated that Mexico could claim the islands and seek their return through litigation before the International Court of Justice. However, a detailed analysis of its situation puts in doubt the likelihood of Mexico winning the case at the International Court of Justice.\\n\\n\\n== Military use ==\\nThe United States Navy controls San Nicolas Island and San Clemente Island, and has installations elsewhere in the chain. During World War II all of Southern California\\u2019s Channel Islands were put under military control, including the civilian-populated Santa Catalina where tourism was halted and established residents needed permits to travel to and from the mainland. San Miguel Island was used as a bombing range and Santa Barbara Island as an early warning outpost under the presumed threat of a Japanese attack on California. Santa Rosa Island was used in 1952 as a base for the USAF 669th AC&W Squadron and they operated two Distant Early Warning FPS-10 radars from the hilltops there. In 1955 another FPS-3 search radar was added, and in 1956, a GPS-3 search radar was installed. A new MPS-14 long-range height-finder radar was installed in 1958. The base was shut down in March 1963, when the 669th was moved to Vandenberg AFB In Lompoc, CA.\\n\\n\\n== Wildlife ==\\n\\nThe Channel Islands are part of one of the richest marine biospheres of the world. Many unique species of plants and animals are endemic to the Channel Islands, including fauna such as the Island Fox, Channel Islands Spotted Skunk, Island Scrub Jay, Ashy Storm-petrel, Island fence lizard, Island Night Lizard, Channel Islands Slender Salamander, Santa Cruz sheep, San Clemente loggerhead shrike, San Clemente sage sparrow and flora including a unique subspecies of Torrey Pine and Oak and the Island Tree mallow.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nGuadalupe Island and the Coronado Islands of Baja California, Mexico share the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion with the Channel Islands\\nDwarf elephant on Channel Islands\\nList of islands of California\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nChannel Islands National Park\\nChannel Islands National Marine Sanctuary\\nAnacapa Island Site with Photos and History\\nCatalina Island Life During WWII\\n\"Military Wants Santa Rosa Island\" LA Times 12/10/05\\n\"The Channel Islands: Special Places in the Garden\\'s History,\" Santa Barbara Botanic Garden Newsletter: Part 2 | Part 3 | Part 4 | Part 5 (Part 1 not online)\\nA review in The New York Times, February 2011, by Barbara Kingsolver, of T.

The club posted a 6\\u20134\\u20132 record, finished in a tie for third (and last) place in the Western Division, and failed to return to the championship game. The Bears had little trouble with the weaker teams in the league, led the league in scoring, and occasionally showed signs of brilliance against top-flight competition, but for the most part they were outclassed by the Lions, Packers, and Giants. The biggest problem was the veterans from the 1920s had largely retired or were past their prime but not enough young talent had emerged to offset these losses. In particular, the retirement of Link Lyman and Red Grange hurt the team, especially on defense. Additionally, Bronko Nagurski and Bill Hewitt were injured for large portions of the season and could not play to their normal level.\\n\\n\\n== Season highlights ==\\nKeith Molesworth was the brightest spot on offense, and was a triple threat from the halfback position. Bernie Masterson ran the T-formation adequately but was not particularly accurate as a passer. Luke Johnsos was the most reliable end and led the team in receptions. Gene Ronzani led the club in rushing, but Feathers, Molesworth, and Manders shared rushing duties. Manders had a subpar year as a kicker, making only 1 of 8 field goals. The Bears lost to Green Bay twice, to Detroit once (tying the Lions in the other game), split the series with New York, and beat the Redskins in their only meeting. After a 5\\u20132 start, the Bears faded in the end, winning only 1 of their last 5 games, with one tie. Of note, every other team in the NFL ran either the Single Wing or the A Formation (a variant of the Single Wing run only by the Giants), but the Bears still used the T formation. Many today falsely believe the Bears of the 1940s \"invented\" the modern T and then everyone adopted it. The truth is everyone ran the T when the league began in 1920. All the other teams switched to the Single Wing after it was perfected in the college game. Meanwhile, coach George Halas and his assistants perfected the T, which they never changed from, and other teams switched back from the Single Wing only after the Bears of the 1940s demonstrated the T\\'s superiority.\\n\\n\\n== Future Hall of Fame Players ==\\nBill Hewitt, End\\nGeorge Musso, Tackle\\nBronko Nagurski, Fullback\\n\\n\\n== Other Leading Players ==\\nBeattie Feathers, Halfback\\nLuke Johnsos, End\\nBill Karr, End\\nJoe Kopcha, Guard\\nJack Manders, Fullback / Kicker\\nBernie Masterson, Quarterback\\nKeith Molesworth, Halfback\\nGene Ronzani, Back\\n\\n\\n== Players departed from 1934 ==\\nCarl Brumbaugh, Quarterback (did not play for unknown reasons)\\nRed Grange, Back (retired)\\nWalt Kiesling, Guard (signed by Packers)\\nLink Lyman, Tackle (retired)\\n\\n\\n== Schedule ==\\n\\n\\n== Standings ==\\nW = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, PCT= Winning Percentage, PTS=Points Scored, OPP=Opponents\\' Points\\nNote: Tie games were not officially counted in the standings until 1972', u'Jethro Tull (band)': u'Jethro Tull were a British rock group, formed in Luton, Bedfordshire, in December 1967. Initially playing blues rock, the band\\'s sound soon incorporated elements of British folk music and hard rock to forge a progressive rock signature. The band were led by vocalist/flautist/guitarist Ian Anderson, and have included other significant members such as guitarist Martin Barre, pianist John Evan, drummer Doane Perry, and bassist Dave Pegg.\\nThe group achieved commercial success in 1969 with the folk-tinged blues album Stand Up, which reached No. 1 in the UK charts, and they toured regularly in the UK and the US. Their musical style shifted in the direction of progressive rock with the albums Aqualung, Thick as a Brick and A Passion Play, and shifted again to hard rock mixed with folk rock with Songs from the Wood and Heavy Horses. Jethro Tull have sold over 60 million albums worldwide, with 11 gold and five platinum albums among them. They have been described by Rolling Stone as \"one of the most commercially successful and eccentric progressive rock bands\".\\nThe last works released as a group were in 2003, though the band continued to tour until 2011. In April 2014 as he was concentrating on his solo career, Anderson said that Jethro Tull were finished.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\nThe origins of Jethro Tull can be traced back to Blackpool, where Ian Anderson, Jeffrey Hammond and John Evans were at grammar school together. Anderson was born in Dunfermline, Scotland and grew up in Edinburgh before moving to Blackpool in January 1960. Evans had become a fan of the Beatles after seeing them play \"Love Me Do\" on Granada Television\\'s Scene At 6:30. Though he was an accomplished pianist, he decided to take up the drums, as it was an instrument featured in the Beatles\\' line-up. Anderson had acquired a Spanish guitar and taught himself how to play it, and the pair decided to form a band. The pair recruited Hammond on bass, who brought along his collection of blues records to listen to.\\nThe group initially played as a three piece on local clubs and venues, before Evans became influenced by Georgie Fame and The Animals and decided to switch to organ, recruiting drummer Barrie Barlow and guitarist Mike Stevens from local band the Atlantics. By 1964 the band had recruited guitarist Chris Riley and developed into a six-piece Blue-eyed soul band called the John Evan Band (later the John Evan Smash). Evans had shortened his surname to \"Evan\" at the insistence of Hammond, who thought it sounded better and more unusual. The group recruited Johnny Taylor as a booking agent and began to gig further afield around north west England, playing a mixture of blues and Motown covers. Hammond subsequently quit the band to go to art school. He was briefly replaced by Derek Ward, then by Glenn Cornick. Riley also quit and was replaced by Neil Smith. The group recorded three songs at Regent Sound Studios in Denmark Street, London in April 1967, and appeared at The Marquee club in June.\\nIn November 1967, the band moved to the London area, basing themselves in Luton. They signed a management deal with Terry Ellis and Chris Wright and replaced Smith with guitarist Mick Abrahams, but quickly realised that supporting a 7-piece band was financially impractical, and the group split up. Anderson, Abrahams and Cornick decided to stay together, recruiting Abrahams\\' friend Clive Bunker on drums and becoming a British blues band. Cornick recalled that although Evan left, the band said he was welcome to rejoin at a later date. As the only member not having nearby family, Anderson lived in a bed-sit \"on the verge of starvation\" and worked as a cleaner for the Luton Ritz Cinema to pay the rent.\\n\\n\\n=== Early years (1967\\u201368) ===\\nAt first, the new band had trouble getting repeat bookings and they took to changing their name frequently to continue playing the London club circuit, which included \"Navy Blue\", \"Ian Henderson\\'s Bag o\\' Nails\" and \"Candy Coloured Rain\". Anderson recalled looking at a poster at a club and concluding that the band name he didn\\'t recognise was his. Band names were often supplied by their booking agents\\' staff, one of whom, a history enthusiast, eventually christened them \"Jethro Tull\" after the 18th-century agriculturist. The name stuck because they happened to be using it the first time a club manager liked their show enough to invite them to return. They recorded a session with producer Derek Lawrence, which resulted in the single \"Sunshine Day\". The B-side, \"Aeroplane\" was an old John Evan Band track with the saxophones mixed out. It was released in February 1968 on MGM Records, miscredited to \"Jethro Toe\". Anderson has sinced questioned the misnomer as a way to avoid paying royalties. The more common version, with the name spelled correctly, is actually a counterfeit made in New York. Anderson met up with Hammond while in London and the two renewed their friendship, while Anderson moved into a bedsit in Chelsea with Evan. Hammond became the subject of several songs, beginning with their next single, \"A Song For Jeffrey\".\\nBecause he was living in a cold bed-sit, Anderson bought a large overcoat to keep him warm, and, along with the flute, it became part of his early stage image. It was around this time that Anderson purchased a flute after becoming frustrated with his inability to play guitar as well as Abrahams, and because their managers thought he should remain a rhythm guitarist, with Abrahams becoming the front man.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t want to be just another third-rate guitar player who sounded like a bunch of other third-rate guitar players. I wanted to do something that was a bit more idiosyncratic, hence the switch to another instrument. When Jethro Tull began, I think I\\'d been playing the flute for about two weeks. It was a quick learning curve ... literally every night I walked onstage was a flute lesson.\"\\n\\nThe group\\'s first major break occurred at the National Jazz and Blues Festival at Sunbury-on-Thames in August 1968, where the band drew a rapturous reception and positive reviews in the music press. The band have since claimed the success at Sunbury was that their persistent touring had generated a grassroots following who had all assembled at the festival and encouraged the rest of the audience. Cornick recalled, \"from that moment on, we were a big band.\"\\nThe group recorded their first album, This Was between June and August 1968, and it was released in October, reaching number 10 in the charts. In addition to original material, the album included the traditional \"Cat\\'s Squirrel\", which highlighted Abrahams\\' blues-rock style, while the Rahsaan Roland Kirk \\u2013penned jazz piece \"Serenade to a Cuckoo\" gave Anderson a showcase for his growing talents on the flute. The overall sound of the group at this time was described in the Record Mirror by Anderson in 1968 as \"a sort of progressive blues with a bit of jazz.\"\\nFollowing the album\\'s release, Abrahams left the band in December to form his own group, Blodwyn Pig. There were a number of reasons given for his departure. Abrahams realised that Ellis wanted Anderson to be the frontman and group leader, at the expense of himself, and realised he was unlikely to have the majority share in songwriting. Other reasons given were that Abrahams was a blues purist while Anderson wanted to branch out into other forms of music, and that Abrahams was unwilling to travel internationally or play more than three nights a week. Abrahams himself described his reasons more succinctly: \"I was fed up with all the nonsense, and I wanted to form a band like Blodwyn Pig.\"\\nThe group tried several different replacements for Abrahams. The first was David O\\'List, who had recently left The Nice. After a week\\'s rehearsal, O\\'List didn\\'t show up and lost contact with the group. The next choice was Mick Taylor, who turned the group down because he felt his current gig with John Mayall\\'s Bluesbreakers was a better deal. Following this, the group put an advertisement in Melody Maker which was answered by Tony Iommi. After a few rehearsals, the group appeared in The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus on 11 December. The group performed \"A Song for Jeffrey\", but only Anderson\\'s singing and flute was live; the rest was mimed. Iommi felt closer to his old band, Earth, so he returned to Birmingham to rejoin them. However, his brief time in Jethro Tull instilled a strong work ethic in Iommi. Earth later became Black Sabbath, achieving great commercial success.\\nThe next choice was Martin Barre, who had seen the band perform at Sunbury, and had been tried out at the same audition as Iommi. Barre arranged a second audition with Anderson, who showed him some new songs that were in a different style to the blues they had been recording. Anderson was impressed at Barre\\'s technique, and offered him the job as the new guitarist. Barre played his first gig with Jethro Tull on 30 December 1968 at the Winter Gardens, Penzance.\\n\\n\\n=== Stand Up - Aqualung (1969\\u201371) ===\\nAfter Barre joined, the group did a few shows supporting Jimi Hendrix in Scandinavia, then set out on an extensive tour of the US, supporting Led Zeppelin and Vanilla Fudge. Having attracted a substantial live following, Ellis and Wright asked Anderson, who had become the dominant songwriter, to write a hit single. The result was \"Living In The Past\", which reached No. 3 in May on the UK singles chart and No. 11 in the US, and resulted in an appearance on Top of the Pops. Although other so-called \"serious\" groups actively resisted issuing singles at the time, Jethro Tull felt a hit single was a positive move for the group, although not their main priority.\\nThe next album was Stand Up, recorded during April\\u2013May and August 1969. It was released in September, and quickly reached No. 1 in the UK charts, the only album by the group to do so. Anderson had now established himself as the group\\'s leader and songwriter, and wrote all of the material, aside from his jazzy rearrangement of J. S. Bach\\'s Bourr\\xe9e in E minor BWV 996 (fifth movement). The album cover unfolded to a photo insert of the band attached to the covers like a pop-up book.\\nImmediately after releasing Stand Up, the group set off on their first headlining tour in the US, including an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival. Barre recalled, \"It was really the turning point for Jethro Tull \\u2013 for everything that we were to become and everything we were to inspire in others.\" The band was invited to play in the Woodstock Festival, but Anderson declined, being afraid that the band would be permanently typecast as hippies, only able to play one musical style.\\n\\nEvan rejoined the band in early 1970. He had stayed in London since the John Evan Band broke up, living with Anderson, and began studying music at the University of London. The pair didn\\'t see much of each other due to Jethro Tull\\'s increasing workload, and Evan was reluctant to rejoin due to his studies, which gave him access to a free studio. He played as a session musician on the next album, Benefit, following which Anderson stated they needed somebody to play the keyboard parts on tour. His tutor eventually persuaded him that it was a good idea, and Evan formally joined. The album reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 10 in the US, and allowed the group to sell out 20,000-seat arenas, establishing themselves as a premier live act. In August, the band played to one of their largest audiences at the 1970 Isle of Wight festival. The band insisted on a full soundcheck early Sunday morning, before performing later that day.\\nThe Isle of Wight appearance was followed by another US tour, following which Cornick left the band. He was keen to socialise on tour, while the other members became more reclusive and introverted. Cornick said he was fired by Anderson, while the band\\'s official website said he was \"invited to leave\" by Ellis, but given full support and encouragement to form his own band. Cornick subsequently formed Wild Turkey, a band which he revived for Jethro Tull fan conventions decades later. He died in August 2014.\\nAnderson invited Jeffrey Hammond to replace Cornick, buying a new bass for this purpose. However, Hammond had not played an instrument since going to art school shortly after his time in the John Evan Band, and was chosen more for his social compatibility with the other band members than for his musical skills. This line-up released Aqualung in 1971. The album was split into two sides, subtitled \"Aqualung\" and \"My God\", and featured Anderson\\'s opinions about organised religion. Recording the album was problematic due to technical issues in the studio and Hammond\\'s rusty musical skills. On \"Locomotive Breath\", Anderson recorded the backing track on his own, singing along to a hi-hat accompaniment, which the rest of the band recorded on top of later. The album was the first to reach the top ten in the US, peaking at No. 7,  and selling over one million copies, earning it a gold disc by the RIAA in July 1971.\\n\\n\\n=== Progressive Rock (1972\\u201376) ===\\nBecause of the heavy touring schedule and his wish to spend more time with his family, drummer Bunker quit the group after the Aqualung album in May 1971. and was replaced by Barrie Barlow (who was rechristened \"Barriemore\" by Anderson). The lineup of Jethro Tull now consisted entirely of former John Evan Band members from Blackpool, except Barre.\\nBarlow first recorded with the band for the five-track EP Life Is a Long Song Anderson had become annoyed with music critics calling Aqualung a concept album, which he did not intend it to be, and decided in response to \"come up with something that really is the mother of all concept albums\". He had become influenced by Monty Python\\'s humour, and wrote a suite that combined complex musical ideas with a sense of humour in order to make fun of the band, its audience and its critics. The album, released in 1972, became Thick as a Brick, which was co-credited to a fictional schoolboy, Gerald Bostock. It consisted of a single track running over 43 minutes, split over two sides, which was uncommon for rock albums. Although the finished album was a continuous piece of music, it was written and recorded in stages, with the whole band helping with the arrangements. Thick as a Brick was the first Tull album to reach number one on the (US) Billboard Pop Albums chart (the following year\\'s A Passion Play being the only other).\\n\\n1972 also saw the release of Living in the Past, a double-album compilation of remixed singles, B-sides and outtakes (including the entirety of the Life Is a Long Song EP, which closes the album), with the third side recorded live in 1970 at New York\\'s Carnegie Hall concert on 4 November 1970. The album was successful, as it allowed new fans to catch up with early singles, particularly in the US where they had not been popular on initial release. New Musical Express called Jethro Tull one of \"Britain\\'s most important and successful 2nd generation progressive bands\".\\nIn 1973, while in tax exile, the band attempted to produce a double album at France\\'s Ch\\xe2teau d\\'H\\xe9rouville studios (something the Rolling Stones and Elton John among others were doing at the time), but supposedly they were unhappy with the quality of the recording studio and abandoned the effort, subsequently mocking the studio as the \"Chateau d\\'Isaster\". (An 11-minute excerpt was released on the 1988 20 Years of Jethro Tull boxed set, and the complete \"Chateau d\\'Isaster Tapes\" were finally released on the 1993 compilation Nightcap, with overdubbed flute lines where the vocal parts were missing.) They returned to England and Anderson rewrote, quickly recorded, and released A Passion Play (1973), another single-track concept album, with allegorical lyrics focusing on the afterlife. Like Thick as a Brick, A Passion Play contained instrumentation rather uncommon in rock music. The album also featured an interlude, \"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\", which was co-written (along with Anderson and Evan) and narrated by bassist Hammond. A Passion Play sold well but received generally poor reviews, including a particularly damning review of its live performance by Chris Welch of Melody Maker.\\nEven as the band\\'s popularity with critics began to wane around this time, their popularity with the public remained strong, as evidenced by high sales of their follow-up album, 1974\\'s War Child. Originally intended to be a companion piece for a film, it reached number two on the US Billboard charts and received some critical acclaim, and produced the radio mainstays \"Bungle in the Jungle\" and \"Skating Away (On the Thin Ice of the New Day)\". It also included a short acoustic song, \"Only Solitaire\", widely thought to be aimed at L.A. Times rock music critic Robert Hilburn, who had written a harsh review of the Passion Play concerts at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. However, Anderson said the song was written prior to that, and was aimed at music critics in general. The War Child tour also featured a female string quartet playing along with the group on the new material.\\nIn 1975, the band released Minstrel in the Gallery, an album which resembled Aqualung (1971) in that it contrasted softer, acoustic-guitar-based pieces with lengthier, more bombastic works headlined by Barre\\'s electric guitar. Written and recorded during Anderson\\'s divorce from his first wife Jennie Franks, the album is characterised by introspective, cynical, and sometimes bitter lyrics. Critics gave it mixed reviews, but the album came to be acknowledged as one of the band\\'s best by longtime Jethro Tull fans, even as it generally fell under the radar to listeners familiar only with Aqualung (1971). By this point Jethro Tull had been awarded six R.I.A.A. gold records for sales of Stand Up (1969), Aqualung (1971), Thick as a Brick (1972), Living in the Past (1972), A Passion Play (1973) and Minstrel in the Gallery (1975).\\nFor the 1975 tour, David Palmer, who had long been the band\\'s orchestra arranger, officially joined the band\\'s stage show on keyboards and synthesisers. In February 1975 Jethro Tull sold out five nights at the 20,000-seat Los Angeles Forum, prompting Melody Maker to run the headline \"Jethro \\u2013 Now The World\\'s Biggest Band?\". After the tour, bassist Hammond quit the band to pursue painting. John Glascock, who earlier was playing with flamenco-rock band Carmen, a support band on the previous Jethro Tull tour, became the band\\'s new bassist.\\n1976\\'s Too Old to Rock \\'n\\' Roll: Too Young to Die! was another concept album, this time about the life of an aging rocker. Glascock made his first appearance on a Jethro Tull album, contributing backing vocals in addition to the bass lines. Palmer continued to arrange, and he recorded as a guest on two songs.\\nFor the 1976 tour, Jethro Tull became one of the first bands to use giant projection screens for the larger stadium shows. Although Too old... did not sell as well as the other 1970s albums, the 1976 compilation M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull, achieved Platinum Album in U.S. and Gold record in U.K.\\nA television special was recorded showing the development of the album\\'s concept in a live show with the band (fully dressed in the most rock-hard-tongue-in-cheek outfits), but the programme was never officially released.\\n\\n\\n=== Folk Rock (1977\\u201379) ===\\n\\nAt the end of the 1970s, Jethro Tull released a trio of folk rock albums, Songs from the Wood (1977), Heavy Horses (1978), and Stormwatch (1979). Songs from the Wood (1977) was the first Tull album to receive generally positive reviews since the release of Living in the Past (1972).\\nThe band had long had ties to folk rockers Steeleye Span (Tull were the backing band on Steeleye Span front woman Maddy Prior\\'s 1978 solo album Woman in the Wings as a way of repaying her for contributing vocals on the Too Old to Rock \\'n\\' Roll: Too Young to Die! album) and with Fairport Convention (Fairport members Dave Pegg, Martin Allcock, Dave Mattacks and Ric Sanders have all played with Tull at one point or another, as well as folk drummer Gerry Conway who became a Fairport member after playing with Tull). Although not formally considered a part of the folk rock movement (which had actually begun nearly a decade earlier with the advent of Fairport Convention), there was clearly an exchange of musical ideas among Tull and the folk rockers. By this time, Anderson had moved to a farm in the countryside, and his new bucolic lifestyle was clearly reflected on these albums, as in the title track of Heavy Horses (1978), a paean to draught horses.\\nThe band continued to tour, and released a live double album in 1978, titled Bursting Out, which was recorded during the European leg of the Heavy Horses tour. During the US leg of this tour, John Glascock suffered health problems and was replaced by Anderson\\'s friend and former Stealers Wheel bassist, Tony Williams.\\nTheir third folk influenced album, Stormwatch, was released in 1979. Glascock, after having open heart surgery the previous year, died in his home of heart complications. Anderson completed the bass parts for the unfinished songs on the album, and Dave Pegg of Fairport Convention took the bass responsibilities for the Stormwatch tour.\\n\\n\\n=== Jethro\\'s \"Big Split\" and Electronic Rock (1980\\u201384) ===\\nFollowing the Stormwatch tour, Jethro Tull would undergo its largest line-up shuffle to date. Barrie Barlow, depressed and withdrawn after the death of his \"closest friend\" Glascock, quit the band soon after the tour ended. Moreover, Palmer and Evan found their futures in the band to be murky with Anderson\\'s announcement that he wanted to work on a solo album. The two moved on to other projects immediately, including a collaboration that resulted in a classical-based pop/rock band called Tallis. Jethro Tull was left with Anderson (the only original member), Barre and Dave Pegg.\\nTull\\'s first album of the 1980s was intended to be Ian Anderson\\'s first solo album. Anderson retained Barre on electric guitar and Pegg on bass, while adding Mark Craney on drums, and special guest keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson (ex\\u2013Roxy Music, Frank Zappa, Curved Air and UK, the last of which had opened for several shows on Tull\\'s Stormwatch tour). Highlighted by the prominent use of synthesisers, it contrasted sharply with the established \"Tull sound\". After pressure from Chrysalis Records, Anderson decided to release it as a Jethro Tull album. Entitled A (taken from the labels on the master tapes for his scrapped solo album, marked simply \"A\" for \"Anderson\"), it was released in mid-1980. According to biographer David Rees in 2001, Anderson had never intended for the dramatic lineup shift. It was instead the request from Chrysalis Records to release A as a Jethro Tull album rather than an Ian Anderson solo album that gave the appearance of a huge band member turnover.\\nIn keeping with the mood of innovation surrounding the album, Jethro Tull developed a music video titled Slipstream. Four staged and separately-filmed music videos are mixed with concert footage from the A tour. London\\'s Hammersmith Odeon was used for exterior scenes, but the main concert footage was actually from an American performance in Los Angeles, at the Los Angeles Sports Arena (as heard on the Magic Piper ROIO), filmed in November 1980. The video, released in 1981, was directed by David Mallet, who has directed numerous music videos, including the pioneering \"Ashes to Ashes\" video for David Bowie. The electronic style of the A album was even more pronounced in these live performances, and was used to striking effect on some of the older songs such as \"Locomotive Breath\". The more familiar Jethro Tull sound was brought to the fore in an all-acoustic version of \"Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day\" featuring Jobson on mandolin, Pegg on mandola and Craney on bass.\\nJobson and Craney returned to their own work following the A tour and Jethro Tull entered a period of revolving drummers: Gerry Conway, who left after deciding he couldn\\'t be the one to replace Barlow, Phil Collins (as a fill-in for the recently departed Gerry Conway, played with the band at the first Prince\\'s Trust concert in 1982), Paul Burgess (for the US leg of the Broadsword and the Beast tour, and who left to settle down with his family) and permanent drummer Doane Perry.\\n1981 was the first year in their career that the band did not release an album; however some recording sessions took place (Anderson, Barre, Pegg, and Conway, with Anderson playing the keyboards). Some of these tracks were released on the Nightcap compilation in 1993.\\nIn 1982, Peter-John Vettese joined on keyboards, and the band returned to a somewhat folkier sound \\u2013 albeit with synthesisers \\u2013 for 1982\\'s The Broadsword and the Beast. The ensuing concert tour for the album was well attended and the shows featured what was to be one of the group\\'s last indulgences in full-dress theatricality: the stage was built to resemble a Viking longship and the band performed in faux-medieval regalia.\\nAn Anderson solo album (which was in fact an Anderson-Vettese effort) appeared in 1983, in the form of the heavily electronic Walk into Light. Although the album featured electronic soundscapes and synthesiser voicings advanced for its time, as well as cerebral lyrics about the alienating effects of technology, the release failed to resonate with long-time fans or with new listeners. However, as with later solo efforts by Anderson and Barre, some of the Walk into Light songs, such as \"Fly by Night\", \"Made in England\" and \"Different Germany\", later made their way into Jethro Tull live sets.\\nIn 1984, Jethro Tull released Under Wraps, a heavily electronic album with no \"live\" drummer and instead, as on Walk into Light, a drum-machine was used. Although the band were reportedly proud of the sound, the album was not well received, particularly in North America. However, the video for \"Lap of Luxury\" did manage to earn moderate rotation on the newly influential MTV music video channel. Also, the acoustic version of the title track, \"Under Wraps 2\", found some favour over the years and a live instrumental version of the song was included on the A Little Light Music concert CD of 1992. Some long-time Jethro Tull fans regard Under Wraps as one of the band\\'s weaker efforts; however, Martin Barre considers it his favourite (the main riff from the song \"Paparazzi\" also became a regular part of live sets as a part of Barre\\'s solo spots; however, these were the only parts of the album that remained in the live sets after the Under Wraps tour). As a result of the throat problems Anderson developed singing the demanding Under Wraps material on tour, Jethro Tull took a three-year break. Vettese quit the band after the tour, angry at critics for the bad reviews of BSATB, Walk into Light, and Under Wraps. During this hiatus, Anderson continued to oversee the salmon farm he had founded in 1978, although the single \"Coronach\" was released in the UK in 1986 after it was used as the theme tune for a Channel 4 television program called \"Blood of the British\".\\n\\n\\n=== Ian, Barre, Pegg and Perry: the \"hard rock\" Tull (1987\\u201394) ===\\nJethro Tull returned in 1987 with Crest of a Knave. With Vettese absent (Anderson contributed the synth programming) and the band relying more heavily on Barre\\'s electric guitar than they had since the early 1970s, the album was a critical and commercial success. Shades of their earlier electronic excursions were still present, however, as three of the album\\'s songs again utilised a drum machine, with Doane Perry and Gerry Conway sharing drum duties on the other tracks. Prior to the Crest of a Knave tour, keyboardist Don Airey (ex-Rainbow, Ozzy Osbourne, Michael Schenker Group) joined the band.\\nThe band won the 1988 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental, beating the favourite Metallica and their ...And Justice for All album. The award was particularly controversial as many did not consider Jethro Tull hard rock, much less heavy metal. On the advice of their manager, who told them they had no chance of winning, no one from the band attended the award ceremony. In response to the criticism they received over the award, their label, Chrysalis, took out an advertisement in a British music periodical with a picture of a flute lying amid a pile of iron re-bar and the line, \"The flute is a heavy metal instrument.\" In response to an interview question about the controversy, Ian Anderson quipped, \"Well, we do sometimes play our mandolins very loudly.\" In 2007, the win was named one of the ten biggest upsets in Grammy history by Entertainment Weekly In 1992, when Metallica finally won the Grammy in the category, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich joked, \"First thing we\\'re going to do is thank Jethro Tull for not putting out an album this year,\" a play on a Grammy comment by Paul Simon some years before thanking Stevie Wonder for the same thing.\\nThe style of Crest of a Knave (1987) has been compared to that of Dire Straits, in part because Anderson no longer seemed to have the vocal range he once possessed and preferred to use the lower registers, while Martin Barre\\'s guitar sound apparently drifted towards Mark Knopfler\\'s style. Two songs in particular \\u2013 \"Farm on the Freeway\" and \"Steel Monkey\" \\u2013 got heavy radio airplay. The album also contained the popular live song \"Budapest\", which depicts a backstage scene with a shy local female stagehand. Although \"Budapest\" was the longest song on that album (at just over ten minutes), \"Mountain Men\" became more famous in Europe, depicting a scene from World War II in Africa. Ian Anderson referred to the battles of El Alamein and the Falkland Islands, drawing historic parallels of the angst that women left behind by their warrior husbands might have felt:\\n\\ndied in the trenches at El Alamein,\\ndied in the Falklands on TV\\n\\nThey toured this album with \"The Not Quite the World, More the Here and There Tour\". It was also the first time in the band\\'s history, when it, even though rarely, had two electric guitar players on stage (Anderson played rhythm guitar).\\n1988 was notable for the release of 20 Years of Jethro Tull, a five-LP themed set (also released as a three-CD set, and as a truncated single CD version on 20 Years of Jethro Tull: Highlights) consisting largely of rarities and outtakes from throughout the band\\'s history, as well as a variety of live and remastered tracks. It also included a booklet outlining the band\\'s history in detail. Now out of print, it has become a collector\\'s item, although many (but not all) of the outtakes have been included as bonus tracks on remastered releases of the band\\'s studio albums.\\nIn 1989, the band released Rock Island, which met with less commercial and critical success than Crest of a Knave (1987). The lead-off track, \"Kissing Willie\", featured bawdy double-entendre lyrics and over-the-top heavy metal riffing that seemed to take a satiric view of the group\\'s recent Grammy award win. The song\\'s accompanying video found difficulty in receiving airplay because of its sexual imagery. Although Rock Island was something of a miss for the group, a couple of fan favourites did emerge from the album. \"Big Riff and Mando\" reflects life on the road for the relentlessly touring musicians, giving a wry account of the theft of Barre\\'s prized mandolin by a starstruck fan. \"Another Christmas Song\", an upbeat number celebrating the humanitarian spirit of the holiday season, stood out against the brooding and sombre mood of many of the songs on the album and was well received at concerts. It was re-recorded for the 2003 Jethro Tull Christmas Album release.\\n1991\\'s Catfish Rising was a more solid album than Rock Island (1989). Despite being labelled as a \"return to playing the blues\", the album actually is marked by the generous use of mandolin and acoustic guitar and much less use of keyboards than any Tull album of the Eighties. Notable tracks included \"Rocks on the Road\", which highlighted gritty acoustic guitar work and hard-bitten lyrics about urban life and \"Still Loving You Tonight\", a bluesy, low-key ballad.\\n\\n\\n=== Roots to Branches and J-Tull.com: the world music influences (1995\\u201300) ===\\n\\nFollowing the 1992 tour (which included Fairport drummer Dave Mattacks and was documented with A Little Light Music, band\\'s second official live album), Anderson relearned how to play the flute (after his daughter, who took up the flute classes at school, discovered that her father often used the wrong fingering) and began writing songs that heavily featured world music influences. However, the first Tull releases containing the \"relearned\" flute were the 25th Anniversary Box which, as well as the remixes of classic songs and unreleased live material, included a whole CD of old songs from the band\\'s entire career recorded by the current line-up, and a \"Nightcap\" album containing unreleased studio material (mainly from the scrapped pre-Passion Play album), with multiple flute parts re-recorded.\\nDave Pegg left the band, wishing to concentrate on Fairport Convention and not being keen on the world-music direction the band chose, and subsequently most of the bass on 1995\\'s Roots to Branches album was performed by Steve Bailey (a widely recognised session bass player and friend of Doane Perry; Ian Anderson gave up being involved in the rhythm section arrangements on that record, leaving them completely to Bailey and Perry), before Pegg was replaced by bassist Jonathan Noyce.\\nRoots to Branches (1995) and 1999\\'s J-Tull Dot Com were less rock-based than Crest of a Knave (1987) or Catfish Rising (1991). Songs on these albums reflect the musical influences of decades of performing all around the globe. In songs such as \"Out of the Noise\" and \"Hot Mango Flush\", Anderson paints vivid pictures of third-world street scenes. These albums reflected Anderson\\'s coming to grips with being an old rocker, with songs such as the pensive \"Another Harry\\'s Bar\", \"Wicked Windows\" (a meditation on reading glasses), and the gruff \"Wounded, Old and Treacherous\".\\n\\n\\n=== Live albums, World Tours and The Jethro Tull Christmas Album (2001\\u201310) ===\\nIn 2001, Anderson reunited with Cornick, Bunker and Abrahams for small pub dates. It was the first time the original four members had played together since 1968. \"Living with the Past\" includes a documentary that features the band on tour, in Britain and America, in 2001. It also has footage of the 2001 reunion of Jethro Tull\\'s first line up filmed playing in a pub.\\n2003 saw the release of The Jethro Tull Christmas Album, a collection of traditional Christmas songs together with old and new Christmas songs written by Jethro Tull. The album became the band\\'s biggest commercial success since the 1987 Crest of a Knave. An Ian Anderson live double album and DVD was released in 2005 called Ian Anderson Plays the Orchestral Jethro Tull. In addition, a DVD entitled Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970 and a live album Aqualung Live (recorded in 2004) were released in 2005.\\n2006 saw the release of a dual boxed set DVD \"Collector\\'s Edition\", containing two DVDs \\u2013 Nothing Is Easy and Living with the Past. Bassist Jon Noyce left the band in March 2006. Keyboardist Giddings quit the band in July 2006, citing constant touring allowing not enough time for family. They were replaced by David Goodier and John O\\'Hara respectively. In the following year it was released The Best of Acoustic Jethro Tull, a 24-song set of Tull\\'s and Ian Anderson\\'s acoustic performances taken from various albums. Included are a new live acoustic version of \"One Brown Mouse\" and a live performance of the traditional song (attributed to Henry VIII), \"Pastime with Good Company\".\\nIn September 2007, Jethro Tull released CD/DVD Live at Montreux 2003. The concert was recorded on 4 July 2003 and featured, among others, \"Fat Man\", \"With You There to Help Me\" and \"Hunting Girl\", with the longest unchanged line-up: Anderson, Barre, Perry, Noyce and Giddings.\\nIn February 2010, the band were commemorated with a Heritage Award by PRS for Music. A plaque was erected on a Catholic church in Blackpool, where the band performed their first ever gig.\\n\\n\\n=== Ian and Martin go solo. The end of Jethro Tull (2011\\u201314) ===\\n2011 marked the 40th Anniversary of Aqualung (1971). A new re-issue was released with new remix of the album (by Porcupine Tree\\' Steven Wilson) and include a DVD and unreleased songs.\\nDuring interviews in November 2011, Martin Barre stated that there were no current plans for future Jethro Tull work and he does not foresee any Tull concerts through 2013. In 2012, Barre assembled and toured with a group, billed as Martin Barre\\'s New Day, which included Jonathan Noyce that played mostly Tull material.\\nOn 30 January 2012, Anderson announced via the Jethro Tull website that Thick as a Brick 2: Whatever Happened to Gerald Bostock?, a followup to Thick as a Brick would be released on 2 April 2012. It is billed as an Ian Anderson solo album and not a Jethro Tull album. Thick as a Brick 2 had its world premiere on 14 April 2012 at Perth Concert Hall, Scotland, UK, kicking off an expected 18-month tour supporting both the original and new albums.\\nIn November 2013, Anderson announced via the Jethro Tull website that a new album Homo Erraticus would be released in April 2014. This will be followed by tours in the UK and US, during which the album will be played in its entirety. Homo Erraticus will be a prog-rock concept album which, according to Anderson, \"chronicles the weird imaginings of one Ernest T Parritt, as recaptured by the now middle-aged Gerald Bostock after a trip to Mathew Bunter\\'s Old Library Bookshop in Linwell village. Bostock and Bunter came across this dusty, unpublished manuscript, written by local amateur historian Ernest T. Parritt, (1873\\u20131928), and entitled Homo Britanicus Erraticus.\" Like \"Thick as a Brick 2\", \"Homo Erraticus\" is billed as an Ian Anderson solo album.\\nIn an April 2014 interview following the release of Anderson\\'s solo album Homo Erraticus, Anderson announced that from that point on, he would be releasing all his music under his own name. Anderson stated that Tull \"kind of came more or less to an end during the last 10 years or so\", and stated his preference \"in my twilight years, to use my own name for the most part being composer of virtually all Tull songs and music since 1968\".\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nJethro Tull\\'s music has been referenced in popular culture, appearing in movies, (The Anchorman, Almost Famous, Apollo 18) television series (The Simpsons, Breaking Bad, Supernatural, Life on Mars) and commercials.\\nTheir influence on musicians includes Iron Maiden\\'s Steve Harris and Bruce Dickinson, Joe Bonamassa and folk doom metal band Blood Ceremony. Rush\\'s Geddy Lee, for example, said about Jethro Tull: \"I was a massive Tull fan from very young ... and, I hope, that too reflects in Rush. I was mesmerised by Ian Anderson. His presentation was simply magical and he delivered it with such a sense of humour and great style ... We [of Rush] saw it as a huge challenge to try and create something that can seem so dynamic onstage.\"\\nBands who have covered songs from Jethro Tull include Iron Maiden, who recorded their own version of \"Cross Eyed Mary\" for the B-Side of The Trooper. The folk band Turisas recorded \"Broadsword\". Finnish heavy metal band Northern Kings recorded \"Fallen on Hard Times\". \"Rainbow Blues\" was covered by Blackmore\\'s Night, former Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore\\'s band. The song was released on their 2003 album Ghost of a Rose. The Ronnie James Dio band Elf, in 1972 played live versions \"Aqualung\" and \"Cross Eyed Mary\". Also in the seventies, the Italian band Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM) played live a version of \"My God\" and \"Bouree\". In the Stoner Metal compilation Sucking the 70s, there are two covers of Jethro Tull songs: \"Cross-Eyed Mary\" and \"Hymn 43\", from the bands Clutch and Alabama Thunderpussy, respectively.\\n\\n\\n== Members ==\\n\\n\\n=== Timeline ===\\n\\n\\n=== Other musicians ===\\nFollowing the departure of Mick Abrahams in 1968, Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi briefly played guitar for Jethro Tull. The only recording of him with the band is on The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus (1968), although his guitar is not heard as all of the music (except Ian Anderson\\'s vocals and flute) was dubbed in afterwards. It was a one-off performance, and Iommi returned to Black Sabbath (then called Earth) in January 1969.\\nDavid O\\'List briefly played with Jethro Tull in 1968 after the expulsion of Abrahams.\\nGenesis\\' Phil Collins was Jethro Tull\\'s drummer for only one gig: the Prince\\'s Trust Gala on 7 July 1982 at London\\'s Dominion Theatre. During this time, Jethro Tull had the position of drummer to fill after the departure of drummer Mark Craney. Collins played on three songs, and two of them (\"Jack in the Green\" and \"Pussy Willow\") are on an official video release of the Prince\\'s Trust Gala.\\nBassist Tony Williams filled in for part of a tour when John Glascock\\'s health failed. He then returned to session playing.\\nBassist Matthew Pegg \\u2013 Dave\\'s son \\u2013 is credited with playing bass on Catfish Rising (1991), when his bald father was \"washing hair\". He also filled in on several dates in the early 1990s. He is currently a session musician, and was also a permanent member of Procol Harum.\\nBassist Steve Bailey appeared on the Roots to Branches (1995) recording, due to Dave Pegg\\'s scheduling conflicts and following departure from the band. He was never an official member of the band.\\nDrummer James Duncan has frequently appeared with the band from 2006 forward, as well as on Anderson\\'s solo tours. Surgery performed on Doane Perry required him to cease playing for some time, and while he has returned to the band, Duncan continues to play some shows. Duncan is Ian Anderson\\'s son.\\nFlorian Opahle, a German guitarist who has played on Anderson\\'s solo tours, as well as with Greg Lake, has recently filled in for Barre on occasion, most notably due to the latter\\'s recuperation from surgery, and in 2009, his playing in \"Excalibur: The Celtic Rock Opera\".\\nMark Mondesir is a British drummer mostly noted for his jazz work. He drummed with Tull and Ian Anderson as a fill-in for James Duncan in 2009, who broke a shoulder whilst skiing.\\nGuitarist Joe Bonamassa guested with Jethro Tull for the encore of their performance at High Voltage 2011.\\nScott Hammond, a British jazz drummer, replaced Mark Mondesir for Ian Anderson\\'s 2011 concerts. Hammond continues to tour with Anderson in 2012, and he played on the new Anderson album, Thick as a Brick 2, which was released in April 2012. Hammond also filled in for Doane Perry during Jethro Tull\\'s concerts in 2011.\\nSince 2005, subsequently Lucia Micarelli, Ann Marie Calhoun and Anna Phoebe played violin regularly with the band.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\nStudio albums\\nThis Was (1968)\\nStand Up (1969)\\nBenefit (1970)\\nAqualung (1971)\\nThick as a Brick (1972)\\nA Passion Play (1973)\\nWar Child (1974)\\nMinstrel in the Gallery (1975)\\nToo Old to Rock \\'n\\' Roll: Too Young to Die!

Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2013.', u'Xavier University (Cincinnati)': u'Xavier University (/\\u02c8ze\\u026avi\\u0259r/ ZAY-vee-\\u0259r) is a co-educational Jesuit, Catholic university located in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. The school is the sixth-oldest Catholic and fourth-oldest Jesuit university in the nation. Xavier has an undergraduate enrollment of 4,485 students and graduate enrollment of 2,165. Xavier is primarily an undergraduate, liberal arts institution. Graduate programs include occupational therapy, education, counseling, nursing, English, theology, psychology, and business.\\n\\n\\n== Campus ==\\nThe campus covers approximately 190 acres (0.77 km2)  in the city of Cincinnati (North Avondale and Evanston, OH) and the City of Norwood, OH and features both residential and academic malls, flanked by the older west campus and by the expanding east campus. At the center of campus are the Gallagher Student Center and Bellarmine Chapel. Bellarmine Chapel\\'s roof is in the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid, also known as a saddle roof, that will not collapse, even if the Chapel walls were removed. The chapel is the home to the Bellarmine Catholic Parish.\\n\\n\\n=== Academic Mall ===\\nSix buildings with castle architecture sit elevated overlooking Victory Parkway to the west and resemble a single fortress. Adjacent to the Gallagher Student Center (north to south) is Science Row: Lindner Hall (Physics), Logan Hall (Chemistry) and Albers Hall (Biology). Hinkle Hall, the oldest standing building on campus (1919), sits in the middle of this impressive chain and is a three-story Tudor-Gothic structure whose turrets were modeled after the Xavier Family Castle in Navarre, Spain. It houses the departments of Math, English, History, Philosophy, and Theology. Schmidt Hall sits next as the University\\u2019s current Administration Building, followed by Edgecliff Hall. Originally Alumni Science Hall (1919), it was renamed after the former Edgecliff College and is home to the Department of Music.\\nOn the opposite side of the mall to the east stands the tallest structure on campus, Schott Hall. It houses the Office of Admission and Office of Financial Aid in addition to the Departments of Modern Languages, Classics, Communication Arts, and Political Science/Sociology. Next (south to north) is McDonald Library followed by Alter Hall, which is currently being rebuilt. Alter Hall is the main classroom building on campus, and is scheduled to be reopened for the 2015 fall semester. Finally, Hailstones Hall, which was the former home of the Williams College of Business, is adjoined behind Alter to the east, so is not truly on the mall. Alter and Hailstones are adjacent to Bellarmine Chapel.\\n\\n\\n=== Residential Mall ===\\nTo the north of the Academic Mall and on the opposite side of the Gallagher Student Center and Bellarmine Chapel is the Residential Mall. All four underclassmen residence halls are here. Brockman Hall is due north of Gallagher and is an all-freshmen community-style residence where about 300 students have one or two roommates and share a bathroom with their wing. Diagonally north across the mall is Buenger Hall. Buenger accommodates over 200 freshmen and sophomore athletes and honors students in suites. Diagonally south across the mall from Brockman and due east of Gallagher are Kuhlman Hall and Husman Hall. Kuhlman and Husman together house about 1,000 freshmen and sophomore students and feature suite style, where students have one or two roommates and share a bathroom with another room. Between Kuhlman, Husman, and Gallagher is what is commonly referred to as \"The Greenspace,\" a large open all-purpose area for students and events.\\n\\n\\n=== Across Victory ===\\nOn the opposite side of Victory Parkway from the Academic and Residential malls is west campus. It is home to most of the athletics and recreational sports with facilities including J. Page Hayden Field, Corcoran Soccer Field, Schmidt Fieldhouse, Corbett Physical Education Building, and the O\\'Connor Sports Center. St. Barbara Hall and the Armory are home to Xavier\\'s ROTC. Joseph Hall and Elet Hall are home to the School of Education and Department of Psychology.\\n\\n\\n=== Cintas Center and Cohen Center ===\\nThe Cintas Center, where the Musketeers host their basketball games, is adjacent to the Residential Mall. Besides the 10,250-seat arena, Cintas also includes the Hoff Student Dining Center, the Schiff Conference Center and the James and Caroline Duff Banquet Center. Cintas is surrounded on all sides by several parking lots and, on the far east side, is the A. B. Cohen Center. Cohen is the home to the Art Department and Xavier Art Gallery, as well as the School of Nursing and departments of Criminal Justice, Social Work, Occupational Therapy, Health Services Administration, and some of the offices of the School of Education.\\n\\n\\n=== Significant Campus Growth ===\\nAs part of the latest construction on campus, a new residential complex called Fenwick Place is opened in fall 2011 to the west of The Commons and south of the Residential Mall. It features 4 residential towers with 535 beds in a suite-style setup, similar to Buenger Hall, for sophomores and juniors. It is the home to a new dining center for all of campus. Fenwick Place opened for the 2011\\u20132012 academic year. The Hoff Academic Quadrangle], located to the south of Fenwick Place and east of the Academic Mall, opened in 2010. Smith Hall, is home to the Williams College of Business and features a Wall Street-style trading center with Bloomberg Terminals and two stock tickers. Smith is also home to Xavier\\'s MBA programs and Xavier\\'s Entrepreneurial Center. The D\\'Artagnan Capital Fund (Xavier\\'s undergraduate student investment fund) is located in the building\\'s Fifth Third Trading Center. Xavier\\'s Entrepreneurship is ranked 11th nationally according to The Princeton Review. The Conaton Learning Commons is west of Smith Hall and adjacent to the Academic Mall. The Learning Commons is home to all of Xavier\\'s academic support services.\\n\\n\\n== Academics and demographics ==\\n\\nXavier University offers 81 majors within the colleges of Arts and Sciences, Social Sciences, Health and Education, and the Williams College of Business. Several minors and pre-professional programs are also offered. All students must complete the core curriculum.\\nUndergraduate students attending Xavier must complete a significant number of distribution requirements that are more commonly known as the Core Curriculum. There are required courses in: Theology, Philosophy, Mathematics, Fine Arts, History, Physical Science, Literature, Foreign Language, and the Social Sciences. The Core Curriculum is a confluence of Jesuit ideals, and Great Books rigors, known as Ratio Studiorum. All graduates, upon completion of a Bachelor degree have read The Republic, Discourse on Method, and selections from the Bible among other original texts.\\n\\n\\n=== Major requirements ===\\nAll undergraduate students are required to complete the Core Curriculum (see above) and comply with departmental requirements. Business majors (from the Williams College of Business) are also required to complete the Business Core, which consists of courses in Accounting, Business Law, Economics, Finance, Human Resources, Information Systems, Management, Marketing, and Statistics (the Business Core occupies 35 credit hours). Business majors, therefore, are only required to take 18\\u201321 hours in their chosen field (providing many students with an incentive to declare second major within the Williams College of Business). Students in the other colleges (the College of Social Sciences and the College of Arts and Sciences) generally have to complete at least 60 credit hours of courses within the major and electives within the College. 120 credit hours must be obtained to graduate with a B.A. or B.S. degree, and all students must achieve a 2.0 GPA minimum in their major course of study. Most scholarships require a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Transfer scholarships are awarded based on GPA from previous university attended.\\nCertain majors; such as Politics Philosophy and the Public (PPP), Honors Bachelor of Arts (HAB), and Philosophy require a written thesis and defense before a selected committee. Philosophy also requires a written comprehensive exam.\\n\\n\\n=== Honorary Societies\\' Chapters ===\\nXavier is home to several honorary societies chapters, including:\\nAlpha Sigma Nu,the honor society of Jesuit institutions of higher education\\nBeta Alpha Psi, an honor organization for financial information students and professionals \\nBeta Gamma Sigma chapter,the international honor society serving business programs accredited by AACSB International.\\nPhi Beta Kappa chapter, an elite honor society present within only 10% of universities.\\nMortar Board, national honor society recognizing college seniors,\\n\\n\\n=== Rankings ===\\nXavier was ranked 4th among 142 Midwest colleges and universities by U.S. News & World Report for its 2013 edition of America\\'s Best Colleges report.\\nIt was ranked 1st for average six-year graduation rate in the Midwest at 78%, 3rd for alumni giving and 2nd for \"up and coming schools.\"\\nKiplinger\\'s Personal Finance listed Xavier 70th among 100 private college and universities as a \"Best Value\" for 2013.\\nForbes ranked 220th among America\\'s Top Colleges for 2013, 174th among private colleges and 46th in the Midwest.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nXavier University was the first Catholic institution of higher learning in the Northwest Territory and is the fourth oldest Jesuit University and the sixth oldest Catholic university in the United States. The school was founded in 1831 as a men\\'s college in downtown Cincinnati, adjacent to St. Francis Xavier Church on Sycamore Street. The Athenaeum, as it was then called, was dedicated to the patronage of Saint Francis Xavier by Bishop Edward Fenwick. Upon Bishop John Baptist Purcell\\'s request, the Society of Jesus took control of The Athenaeum in 1840, and the name was changed to St. Xavier College in honor of the 16th century Jesuit missionary, St. Francis Xavier who, like the founder of the Jesuits, Ignatius Loyola, was a Spanish Basque. St. Xavier College moved in 1912 to its current North Avondale location, about 5 miles (8.0 km) north of downtown, after the purchase of 26 acres (0.11 km2) from the Avondale Athletic Club. The \"original\" Anthenaeum is now the seminary of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. St. Xavier College and St. Xavier High School officially split in 1919, though did not become financially independent until 1934. The name of the school was changed a second time to its current name, Xavier University, in 1930.\\nThe Williams College of Business was established in 1961 and Xavier\\'s first Doctoral Program in Psychology was initiated in 1997. Xavier fully admitted women in 1969, but women began attending the college in 1914 in the evening, weekend, and summer school divisions. Edgecliff College, another Catholic college in Cincinnati, merged with Xavier University in 1980 due to financial troubles.\\nIn 2000, Xavier opened its doors to its new \"living room\" in the Cintas Center, an on-campus home for the Musketeers. Xavier also opened in 2002 the Gallagher Student Center.\\nA new residential complex named Fenwick Place opened in the fall of 2011 as part of current campus expansion plans. Smith Hall and the Conaton Learning Commons opened in 2010 as part of the James E. Hoff, S.J, Academic Quadrangle. Fr. Hoff was the University\\'s 33rd President, 1991\\u20132000. Fr. Michael J. Graham, S.J., Hoff\\'s successor and 34th President, still serves Xavier today.\\n\\n\\n== Athletics ==\\n\\nXavier competes at the NCAA Division I level in the Big East Conference, and their mascot is D\\'Artagnan the Musketeer. Xavier sponsors eight intercollegiate sports for men, and eight sports for women. The University\\'s graduation rate of 94% is the third highest graduation rate for athletes in the nation behind Duke University and Stanford University. Xavier sports teams have several traditional rivalries with local universities, including the University of Cincinnati and the University of Dayton.\\nXavier was a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference where it enjoyed many successful basketball seasons. On March 20, 2013, the Xavier administration announced that the school will join the Big East, and moved to the new conference July 1, 2013.\\n\\n\\n=== Men\\'s basketball ===\\n\\nThe Xavier men\\'s basketball team is perhaps the best known of the sports sponsored at Xavier. The team has enjoyed considerable recent success, reaching the Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament in 2004 and 2008. Since 1985, every men\\'s basketball player who has played as a senior has graduated with a degree. Xavier is one of only two non-BCS schools to be listed among the top 20 most valuable programs in college basketball (the other being UNLV) according to Forbes.\\n\\n\\n=== Football ===\\n\\nXavier fielded an NCAA Division I football team until the 1973 season; therefore, fans often claim that Xavier is \"undefeated since 1973\".\\n\\n\\n=== Baseball ===\\nThe Xavier Baseball team won the 2014 Big East Championship and participated in the Nashville Regional. The 2009 Xavier Baseball team won the Atlantic 10 tournament and participated in the Houston Regional.\\n\\n\\n=== Club sports ===\\nThe club sports program is designed to serve the interests of Xavier University students, faculty, and staff in different sports and recreational activities. These interests may be competitive, recreational and/or instructional in nature.\\n\\n\\n=== Mascots ===\\nXavier is one of a handful of universities with two mascots. D\\'Artagnan, the Musketeer, is the university\\'s official mascot and is the origin of the school\\'s nickname, The Xavier Musketeers. The Musketeer concept was suggested in 1925 by the late Reverend Francis J. Finn, S.J. The Blue Blob is a furry creature that has made several television and magazine appearances over the years, including a controversial PlayBoy appearance. The Blue Blob has Bobble-Body dolls, Plush replicas, and T-shirts made in his likeness, and an annual Blue Blob Appreciation Night during the Musketeer\\'s basketball season. He most recently appeared on two ESPN This is SportsCenter commercials with Pro Football Hall of Fame member Jim Kelly and Sports Center anchors Scott Van Pelt and John Anderson. The Blue Blob came about in 1985 when the spirit squad coordinators realized that a more audience-friendly mascot was needed as the musketeer mascot, who sported a handlebar mustache and a prop sword, scared younger spectators.\\n\\n\\n=== Media ===\\nMost Xavier games can be heard on WLW or WKRC-AM. Joe Sunderman does the play-by-play and Byron Larkin does color commentary. Fox Sports Net Ohio holds the local television rights to the Musketeers basketball games. Brad Johansen does play-by-play and Steve Wolf is the analyst. Over the air stations, WCPO-TV and WSTR-TV, have held the rights to Xavier games in the past.\\n\\n\\n== Notable alumni ==\\nXavier has a number of notable alumni, including:\\n\\n\\n== Notable faculty ==\\nArthur J. Dewey, New Testament scholar\\nJohn J. Gilligan, Congressman and Governor of Ohio\\nPaul F. Knitter, Theologian\\nRichard Polt, Heidegger Scholar, and Manual Typewriter Enthusiast.\\nHenry Heimlich, \"inventor\" of Heimlich Maneuver.

The company switched to gasoline-fuelled internal combustion engine-powered automobiles in January 1903, and went out of business later that year.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nCentury Motor Vehicle Company was founded in Syracuse, New York in 1899. At the very start of the automobile industry\\'s history, a group connected with the Barnes Cycle Company, including bicycle racer and designer, William Van Wagoner from New Jersey, began to tinker with automobiles, as did all other bicycle producers of the day. Van Wagoner and partner Charles F. Saul had a prototype ready by 1899 which was named the Van Wagoner. Founders of the company were Saul, Van Wagoner, Charles Listman, Charles A. Bridgman and Hiram W. Plumb.\\nBarnes Bicycle Co., whose White Flier sold for $125 or more, was absorbed by the American Bicycle Company in 1900. The next year, the group from Barnes produced a few runabouts and named their car the Century.\\nIn July 1901, the company had such a demand for the output of the factory that the stockholders increased capital and proposed to increase the capacity of the plant in East Water Street.\\n\\n\\n=== Steam-powered ===\\nIn the beginning, Century manufactured both an electric and a steam-powered runabout. The steam engine was a two-cylinder vertical marine type that was almost five-horsepower. An incline shaft drive to the rear axle was an unusual feature of the Century, which could maintain 25 miles per hour (40 km/h) at 175 psi of steam produced in its water-tube boiler.\\nInstead of the usual chain drive, the Century steamer employed shaft drive and a bevel gear drive, a very modern solution.\\n\\n\\n=== Machinist strike ===\\nBy May 21, 1901, William Van Wagoner was manager. The company\\'s machinists went on strike and Van Wagoner made an announcement to The Post-Standard reporter that the firm was going to \"shut down immediately\" for an indefinite period. He expressed that they were a new company, still in their infancy and could not afford the \"new schedule.\" Fifty men lost their jobs.\\nThe next day, on May 22, Van Wagoner announced that a number of men employed at the factory on East Water Street who were locked out had returned to work, and that the factory would be \"running again today.\" He said that a number of the non-union men had signed an agreement to go out with the union machinists if their demands were not granted. Many of the men had since \"asked to be reinstated\" and the plant had run the day before with a few of the men working.\\nThe secretary of Machinists Union No. 381 had been notified that the following firms had signed the union\\'s schedule for a nine-hour day and 12.5 percent increase in wages: Onondaga Dynamo Company, E. C. Powell,Frick Brothers, Merrell & Soule Company, George S. Herrick, Syracuse Time Recorder Company, Houser Elevator Company, Sanderson Brothers machine shop, Doyle & Devereaus and M. J. Meyers.\\n\\n\\n=== Van Wagoner design ===\\n\\nOn May 27, 1902, William Van Wagoner took a trip to Auburn, New York, in a vehicle he designed that was manufactured by Century Motor Vehicle Company. He was joined on that \"unpleasant day\" by John Maxwell, casket manufacturer from Oneida, New York. Van Wagoner\\'s goal was to try for a record of a mile in 58 seconds.\\n\\n\\n=== Auto show ===\\nIn November 1902, Century was an exhibitor at the Madison Square Garden Show in New York City. The event included 114 firms such as Brennan Motor Manufacturing Company of Syracuse, Buckmobile Company of Utica, New York and H. H. Franklin Manufacturing Company, also of Syracuse.\\n\\n\\n=== Internal combustion-powered ===\\nBy January 1903, the company switched to production of gasoline-fueled automobiles with a model called the Century Tourist which was equipped with a single-cylinder, water-cooled internal combustion engine of seven-horsepower. The car had a newly designed carburetor and a planetary gear system which had two speeds; forward and reverse. The wheels were 28-inch (710 mm) in diameter, fitted with 3-inch (76 mm) detachable tires. The wheelbase was 6 feet (1.8 m) and the power equipment was hung on a 2-inch (51 mm) steel I-beam frame, on which the body also rested. The power equipment could be removed by taking out eight bolts. The car weighed 1,100 pounds and had a maximum speed of 22 miles per hour (35 km/h).\\nIn April 1903, the company advertised their latest model, the Century Tourist for $750. The car was described as having a \"roomy body, with a wide and comfortable seat, an unusually long wheelbase, complete with the Century spring suspension, on four long and elastic springs.\" The vehicle was \"carefully designed\" after years of experience in motor vehicle building and thoroughly tested for months before it was placed upon the market. It had a one-cylinder water-cooled motor of seven-horsepower which \"runs with little noise or vibration.\" The company bragged that the motor \"can be started from the ground or seat\" and due to a new starting device, a \"back kick\" was now impossible. The body could be removed from the steel frame by removing eight bolts and the gasoline tank capacity was enough for a run of 175 miles (282 km). The box front was entirely designed for luggage and every part in the car was interchangeable. The transmission and power equipment was easily accessible and one level controlled two-speeds forward and reverse. The car also had two double-acting brakes and 28-inch (710 mm) artillery wheels and 3-inch (76 mm) detachable tires. The engine and body were all built by Century.\\n\\n\\n=== Representatives ===\\nBy April 1903, the company had representatives in New York City, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Providence, Rhode Island, New Britain, Connecticut, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Buffalo, New York, Asbury Park, New Jersey, Central New York and London, England.\\n\\n\\n=== Syracuse facilities ===\\nA motoring magazine in the early days, announced in January 1902, that the company had purchased the building they were conducting business from. \"This gives a first-class factory with opportunity for enlarging same, and the Century product will be pushed with unusual vigor.\" Century had gone to great expense purchasing new machinery and had one of the \"finest automobile plants in the country.\" The machinery in the building cost $50,000.\\n\\n\\n=== Company failure ===\\nCentury took enough orders at the New York Auto Show in 1902 to keep its factory busy during the entire year and the automobile world was greatly surprised early in the summer of 1903 that the company had closed its factory and called a meeting of its creditors, offering to settle for 25 cents on a dollar.\\nIn February 1904, the company was forced into insolvency after a petition in involuntary bankruptcy was filed against them in the United States court in Utica, New York following the filing of a judgment by the American Ball Bearing Company of Cleveland, Ohio in the sum of $4,085. There were a total of 188 creditors whose claims were principally for machine parts. The total liabilities amounted to $70,000, of which about $40,000 was for open accounts. The assets of the company were estimated between $50,000 and $60,000. The firm had been in the hands of the creditors since July 1903, when 200 employees were laid off and the manufacture of automobiles ceased. Some of the largest creditors included Crucible Steel Company of America and Gavin Machine Company of New York City. According to the local newspaper; \"the stockholders were all Syracuse men.\"\\nFor a few months, there was discussion of Century Motor Vehicle Company merging with J. S. Leggett\\'s, Iroquois Motor Car Company who manufactured the body for Century, however, that did not occur because Century had too many liabilities.\\nIn the four years of operation, the firm produced an electric, then a steam and finally a gasoline machine. A magazine article noted that \"Century not only had a good reputation, but one well deserved, being of good design, with ample power.\"\\n\"The company produced an excellent gasoline machine but was unable to swing the amount of business it undertook.\" This fact, coupled with the impossibility to turn out cars at the price which it was estimated they could be produced, forced the company to go out of business \"until matters could be straightened out, the probability being that before the new year is far gone either the Century company or a new concern will be turning out automobiles in East Water Street.\"\\n\\n\\n== Advertisements ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nThe Century Steam Car & The Century Motor Vehicle Co.\\nEarly American Automobiles, 1904 models', u'Vogue Paris': u'The French edition of Vogue magazine, Vogue Paris, is a fashion magazine that has been published since 1920.\\n\\n\\n== 1920\\u201354 ==\\n\\nThe French edition of Vogue was first issued on June 15, 1920. More information about French Vogue in the 1920s is available in Mary E. Davis\\'s book Classic Chic: Music, Fashion, and Modernism (University of California Press, 2006, ISBN 0-520-24542-3). Michel de Brunhoff was the magazine\\'s editor-in-chief from 1929 until 1954.\\n\\n\\n== Under Edmonde Charles-Roux (1954\\u201366) ==\\nEdmonde Charles-Roux, who had previously worked at Elle and France-Soir, became the magazine\\u2019s editor-in-chief in 1954. Charles-Roux was a great supporter of Christian Dior\\'s \"New Look\", of which she later said, \"It signalled that we could laugh again - that we could be provocative again, and wear things that would grab people\\'s attention in the street.\" In August 1956, the magazine issued a special ready-to-wear (pr\\xeat-\\xe0-porter) issue, signaling a shift in fashion\\'s focus from couture production.\\nShe left Vogue in 1966, as the result of a conflict for wanting to place a black woman on the cover of the magazine. When later asked about her departure, Charles-Roux refused to confirm or deny this account.\\n\\n\\n== 1968-2000: Crescent, Pringle, and Buck ==\\nFrancine Crescent, whose editorship would later be described as prescient, daring, and courageous, took the helm of French Vogue in 1968. Under her leadership, the magazine became the global leader in fashion photography. Crescent gave Helmut Newton and Guy Bourdin, the magazine\\'s two most influential photographers, complete creative control over their work. During the 1970s, Bourdin and Newton competed to push the envelope of erotic and decadent photography; the \"prone and open-mouthed girls of Bourdin\" were pitted against the \"dark, stiletto-heeled, S&M sirens of Newton\". At times, Bourdin\\'s work was so scandalous that Crescent \"laid her job on the line\" to preserve his artistic independence. The two photographers greatly influenced the late-20th-century image of womanhood and were among the first to realize the importance of image, as opposed to product, in stimulating consumption.\\nBy the late 1980s, however, Newton and Bourdin\\'s star power had faded, and the magazine was \"stuck in a rut\". Colombe Pringle replaced Crescent as the magazine\\'s editor-in-chief in 1987. Under Pringle\\u2019s watch, the magazine recruited new photographers such as Peter Lindbergh and Steven Meisel, who developed their signature styles in the magazine\\u2019s pages. Even still, the magazine struggled, remaining dull and heavily reliant on foreign stories. When Pringle left the magazine in 1994, word spread that her resignation had been forced.\\nJoan Juliet Buck, an American, was named Pringle\\'s successor effective June 1, 1994. Her selection was described by The New York Times as an indication that Conde Nast intended to \"modernize the magazine and expand its scope\" from its circulation of 80,000. Buck\\'s first two years as editor-in-chief were extremely controversial; many employees resigned or were fired, including the magazine\\'s publishing director and most of its top editors. Though rumors circulated in 1996 that the magazine was on the verge of a shutdown, Buck persevered; during her editorship, the magazine\\u2019s circulation ultimately increased 40 percent. Buck remade the magazine in her own cerebral image, tripling the amount of text in the magazine and devoting special issues to art, music, literature, and science. Juliet Buck announced her decision to leave the magazine in December 2000, after her return from a two-month leave of absence. The Sydney Morning Herald later compared her departure, which took place during Milan\\'s fashion week, to the firing of a football coach during a championship game. Carine Roitfeld, who had been the magazine\\'s creative director, was named as Buck\\'s successor the next April.\\n\\n\\n== Under Carine Roitfeld (2001\\u201311) ==\\nRoitfeld aimed to restore the magazine\\'s place as a leader in fashion journalism (the magazine \"hadn\\'t been so good\" since the 1980s, she said) and to [restore] its French identity. Her appointment, which coincided with the ascendance of young designers at several of the most important Paris fashion houses, \"brought a youthful energy\" to the magazine. By April 2002, she had rid the magazine of foreign staffers, making it \"all French for the first time in many years\". The magazine also underwent a redesign by the Paris-based design firm M/M.

Roitfeld has periodically drawn criticism for the magazine\\'s use of sexuality and humor, which she employs to disrupt fashion\\'s conservatism and pretension. Roitfeld\\'s Vogue is unabashedly elitist, \"unconcerned with making fashion wearable or accessible to its readers\". Models, not actresses promoting movies, appear on its cover. Its party pages focus on the magazine\\'s own staff, particularly Roitfeld and her daughter Julia Restoin Roitfeld.

He also was a manager for three Major League teams.\\nStricken with fatal lung cancer at the height of his managerial career as leader of the pennant-contending Cincinnati Reds, he was commemorated one year after his death when his brother Dr. William B. Hutchinson created the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center as a division of the Pacific Northwest Research Foundation, in the Hutchinsons\\' native city of Seattle, Washington. The \"Fred Hutch\", which became independent in 1975, is now one of the best-known facilities of its kind in the world.\\n\\n\\n== Pitching career ==\\nFred Hutchinson, known throughout baseball as \"Hutch,\" was a right-handed pitcher who entered the organized baseball ranks in 1938 with the unaffiliated Seattle Rainiers of the AA Pacific Coast League and caused an immediate sensation at age 19, winning a league-best 25 games and that season\\'s Minor League Player of the Year award as bestowed by The Sporting News.\\nAfter his contract was purchased by the Detroit Tigers of the American League, Hutchinson struggled in his early Major League career with a 6\\u201313 record and an earned-run average of 5.43 during the 1939\\u20131941 seasons. His ineffectiveness caused his return to the minor leagues in each season. In 1941, at Buffalo of the AA International League, he enjoyed another stellar campaign, leading the league in victories (26) and innings pitched (284). A successful Major League career seemed to await Hutchinson, then 22, when the U.S. entered World War II. He saw active duty in the U.S. Navy, rose to the rank of lieutenant commander, and lost four full seasons (1942\\u20131945) to military service.\\nIn 1946, Hutchinson \\u2013 approaching 27 \\u2013 returned to baseball with a vengeance, winning a place in the defending World Series champion Tigers\\u2019 starting rotation and beginning a string of six straight campaigns of ten or more wins, including seasons of 18 (1947) and 17 victories (1950). He was selected to the 1951 American League All-Star team, and pitched three innings in an 8-3 loss at Hutchinson\\'s home park, Briggs Stadium.\\nOverall, Hutchinson compiled a 95\\u201371 career record and a 3.73 earned run average over 11 seasons, all with Detroit \\u2013 a stellar mark considering his early-career mishaps. Appearing in 242 games, 169 as a starting pitcher, and 1,464 innings pitched, he allowed 1,487 hits and 388 bases on balls. He amassed 591 strikeouts, 81 complete games, and 13 shutouts, along with seven saves. He led the American League in WHIP in 1949, a season in which Hutchinson\\'s 2.96 ERA was fourth in the league.\\nThe 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), 190 lb (86 kg) Hutchinson was known as a ferocious competitor. \"His displays of temper became legendary in the American League,\" wrote Sports Illustrated in 1957. \"\\'I always know how Hutch did when we follow Detroit into a town,\\' cracked Yankee catcher Yogi Berra. \\'If we got stools in the dressing room, I know he won. If we got kindling, he lost.\\'\"\\nHe also was one of the best-hitting pitchers of his time; a left-handed batter, he frequently pinch-hit and batted over .300 four times during his Major League career. His career batting average was .263, with 171 hits, four home runs and 83 runs batted in \\u2014 excellent totals for a pitcher.\\nOn a dubious note, he is also recalled as the pitcher who gave up the longest homer in Ted Williams\\' career, a 502-foot (153 m) blast in 1946 that broke the straw hat of a startled fan sitting in Fenway Park\\'s right-center-field bleachers. The seat where the home run landed has been painted red since to mark the long ball. Hutchinson led the AL in home runs allowed with 32 during the 1948 season.\\n\\n\\n== Career as manager ==\\nA slow decline in Hutchinson\\'s pitching career coincided with an alarming drop in the fortunes of his usually contending Tigers. On July 5, 1952, with Detroit in the surprising position of last place in the eight-team American League, the club fired manager Red Rolfe and handed the job to Hutchinson, still an active player and five weeks shy of his 33rd birthday. Hutchinson was chosen based on his leadership skills; he had been the AL\\'s Player Representative since 1947. Hutchinson managed the Tigers for the next 2\\xbd years, serving into 1953 as a playing manager. He guided them from their eighth-place finish in 1952 to sixth and fifth place during the next two seasons. His reign included the 1953 debut of future Baseball Hall of Fame outfielder Al Kaline. However, Detroit\\'s ownership and front office were in flux and, at the end of 1954, Hutchinson was forced out as manager when he asked for a multi-year contract extension. It marked the end of a 16-year association with the Tigers.\\nOut of the Major Leagues for the first time since 1941, Hutchinson went home to Seattle and the Rainiers of the PCL, becoming their manager in 1955. Even though the club did not enjoy a Major League affiliation, Hutchinson led Seattle to a 95\\u201377 record and a first place finish. His success led to his second Major League managerial job when he replaced Harry Walker as skipper of the St. Louis Cardinals for the 1956 season.\\nThe Cardinals, one of baseball\\'s storied franchises, had fallen into the second division. With general manager \"Frantic\" Frank Lane constantly revamping the roster through trades and Hutchinson\\'s steady hand at the helm, the Cardinals improved by eight games in 1956, and catapulted to second place in the National League in 1957, behind only the eventual world champion Milwaukee Braves. Hutchinson won The Sporting News Manager of the Year Award, and his popularity in the Mound City resulted in a new nickname, \"The Big Bear\", bestowed by Cardinal broadcaster Joe Garagiola. Hutchinson\\'s typical unsmiling expression also led Garagiola to joke that Hutchinson was \"really happy inside, only his face didn\\'t know it.\" However, Lane\\'s departure from the St. Louis front office and the Cardinals\\u2019 disappointing 1958 season resulted in Hutchinson\\'s dismissal that September, with the team six games below .500 and in fifth place.\\n\\n\\n== Success in Cincinnati ==\\nOnce again, Hutchinson returned to Seattle as manager of the Rainiers. The 1959 team did not have the on-field success of 1955\\'s edition but the Rainiers were by then the top farm club of the Cincinnati Reds, who had stumbled badly in the National League standings coming out of the gate. In July 1959, with the Reds ten games under .500, Hutchinson was called to Cincinnati to take over the club, replacing Mayo Smith. Under Hutchinson, Cincinnati went 39\\u201335 and improved two notches in the standings, but the following season saw the Reds struggle again to a 67\\u201387 record and sixth place finish. Like Detroit and St. Louis before, the Reds also were in front office turmoil, as the general manager who originally hired Hutchinson, Gabe Paul, departed for the expansion Houston Colt .45s and was replaced by Bill DeWitt. The sudden death of longtime owner Powel Crosley less than three weeks before the start of the 1961 regular season meant the team would soon be sold.\\nAs a result, 1961 was a crucial season for Hutchinson. The Reds were projected as a second division team, lagging well behind the defending world champion Pittsburgh Pirates, the 1959 champion Los Angeles Dodgers, and strong San Francisco Giants, Cardinals and Braves outfits. But the Reds stunned the league. Led by NL MVP Frank Robinson, they were buoyed by three other factors: the maturation of young players such as outfielder Vada Pinson and pitchers Jim O\\'Toole, Ken Hunt and Jim Maloney; the acquisition of key contributors such as pitcher Joey Jay (who became a 20-game winner) and third baseman Gene Freese; and surprise slugging and clutch hitting performances by first baseman Gordy Coleman, Jerry Lynch (one of the greatest pinchhitters in baseball history), and veteran Wally Post. The Reds surged into contention with a nine-game winning streak in May, and took first place for good August 16 when they swept the Dodgers in a doubleheader in Los Angeles.\\nThe season was marked by numerous dramatic late-inning comeback victories, overcoming large margins, sometimes in a single inning. The Reds seemed never to be out of any game, until the last out. The 1961 Reds won 93 games and their first NL pennant since 1940. It would be Hutchinson\\'s second trip to the World Series; ironically, he was a Detroit pitcher in 1940 when his Tigers lost the Fall Classic to Cincinnati in seven games. However, the 1961 Reds drew one of the best teams of its era as its World Series foe: the New York Yankees of Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, et al., who had won 109 games. The Reds could muster only one victory, in Game 2, with utility infielder Elio Chacon racing home on a passed ball with the go-ahead run, barely before the crunching body tag of Elston Howard. Cincinnati lost the 1961 Series in five games.\\n\\n\\n== Final years ==\\nWinning the 1961 pennant secured Hutchinson\\'s place in Cincinnati. In 1962, his Reds won 98 games but finished third, 3\\xbd games behind the Giants. While the team fell to fifth in 1963, with an 86\\u201376 mark, it continued to blend in young talent, such as young shortstop Leo C\\xe1rdenas and freshman second baseman Pete Rose, who was named the National League\\'s Rookie of the Year. With a solid corps of veterans and a strong farm system, the Reds were considered a contending club in 1964, provided that its pitching staff made a comeback.\\nTragically, an off-season medical examination revealed malignant tumors in Hutchinson\\'s lungs, chest and neck. Given the cancer treatments available at the time, the prognosis was grim. The Reds made their manager\\'s illness public on January 3, 1964. As The Sporting News noted, the team played the 1964 season with the terrible knowledge that Hutchinson \"probably was at death\\'s door.\"\\nHis health failing, Hutchinson nevertheless managed the Reds through July 27, when he was hospitalized. He returned to the dugout August 4, but could only endure nine more days before he turned the team over to his first-base coach, Dick Sisler, one day after Hutch\\'s 45th birthday. With their manager now critically ill, the inspired Reds caught fire and won 29 out of their last 47 games as the first-place Philadelphia Phillies collapsed, but the team finished in a tie with the Phillies for second, one game behind the Cardinals, who went on to win that year\\'s World Series.\\nHutchinson formally resigned as manager October 19; he died three weeks later in Bradenton, Florida. SPORT magazine posthumously named him \"Man of the Year\" for 1964 in tribute to his courage in battling his final illness and the Reds permanently retired his uniform number (1). The Hutch Award is given annually by Major League Baseball in his memory as well.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nFred Hutchinson was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1965. His career record as a Major League manager, in all or parts of 12 seasons, was 830\\u2013827 (.501) with nine tie games. He was remembered for his winning baseball teams, as the man who launched Cincinnati into an historic winning era (which ended years after his death with the \"Big Red Machine\" in the 1970s) and for his sometimes hard-driving management of developing talent, such as the young Frank Robinson \\u2014 who according to the sports press of the time felt Hutchinson sometimes rode him excessively hard. On the other hand, he is described favorably by pitcher/author Jim Brosnan in his two season memoirs, The Long Season (an account of Brosnan\\'s 1959 campaign) and Pennant Race (about 1961). Brosnan describes the team\\'s wariness of the manager\\'s hot temper and its respect for his competitive nature and leadership skills, and notes Hutchinson\\'s sense of humor as well.\\nWrote Brosnan in 1959: \"Most ballplayers respect Hutch. In fact, many of them admire him, which is even better than liking him. He seems to have a tremendous inner power that a player can sense. When Hutch gets a grip on things it doesn\\'t seem probable that he\\'s going to lose it. He seldom blows his top at a player, seldom panics in a game, usually lets the players work out of their own troubles if possible.\"\\nSaid Cardinals Hall of Famer Stan Musial in 1957: \"If I ever hear a player say he can\\'t play for Hutch, then I\\'ll know he can\\'t play for anybody.\"\\nIn honor of his achievements with Buffalo, Hutchinson became a charter member of the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.\\nOn December 24, 1999, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer named Hutchinson Seattle\\'s Athlete of the 20th Century.\\nMeanwhile, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center continues to make news as a cancer treatment hub \\u2014 in medical and baseball circles. When Boston Red Sox rookie left-handed pitcher Jon Lester, a Washington native, was diagnosed with anaplastic large cell lymphoma during the 2006 season, he chose to undergo chemotherapy at the Seattle facility. Coming full circle, on November 11, 2008, Lester \\u2014 a 16-game winner and postseason pitching star \\u2014 was chosen as the winner of the 2008 Hutch Award.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n1950 Detroit Tigers season\\nList of Major League Baseball player\\u2013managers\\nList of Major League Baseball full-career one-team players\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nFred Hutchinson managerial career statistics at Baseball-Reference.com\\nCareer statistics and player information from Baseball-Reference, or Fangraphs, or The Baseball Cube, or Baseball-Reference (Minors)\\nKBTC-TV video biography on YouTube\\nFred Hutch video on William and Fred Hutchinson on YouTube\\nWalsh, Emmett, \"In Sunshine or In Shadow,\" Sports Illustrated, August 26, 1957\\nFred Hutchinson at Find a Grave\\nPortrait of Fred Hutchinson by Margaret Holland Sargent\\nThe Dead Ball Era', u'Jamaica Estates, Queens': u'Jamaica Estates is an upper middle class and wealthy neighborhood located in the New York City borough of Queens.

The portion of Jamaica Estates located south of the Grand Central Parkway is more properly termed Holliswood. \\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nJamaica Estates was created at the turn of the century by the Jamaica Estates Company, which developed the hilly terminal moraine\\'s 503 acres (2.04 km2), while preserving many of the trees that had occupied the site. Jamaica Estates now has significant Modern Orthodox Jewish American and South Asian American populations. The latter has been particularly affected by the wave of mortgage foreclosures that began in 2008. The only apartments and multi-family housing lie near the southern border within a few blocks from and along Hillside Avenue. The shopping corridors are along Hillside Avenue and Union Turnpike.\\nIn 2007, following the damage of the roof of the Historic Gatehouse in Hurricane Isabel, the restoration and beautification of the Gatehouse and Malls was completed.\\nThe Jamaica Estates Association, founded in 1929, continues as an active, vital civic organization representing the community.

Numerous express buses (QM1, QM5, QM6, QM7, QM8, and X68) to Manhattan also stop on Union Turnpike.\\nIn contrast to much of Queens, most streets in Jamaica Estates do not conform to the rectangular street grid and follow topographic lines, the most notable example being Midland Parkway. Many of the named streets have etymologies originating from Languages of the United Kingdom, such as Aberdeen, Avon, Hovenden, Barrington, Chelsea, and Chevy Chase Street. However, unlike Forest Hills Gardens, which is a similarly wealthy Queens neighborhood with an atypical Queens street layout, the street numbering system does conform to the rest of Queens, employing the \"dash\" found in the Philadelphia grid street numbering system familiar throughout all other parts of the borough.\\n\\n\\n== Notable residents ==\\nMargaret Bergmann Lambert, German high jump champion of the 1930s (as Gretel Bergmann), later United States champion in high jump (1937 & 38) and shotput (1938).\\nJoseph \"Run\" Simmons, the \"Run\" of Run-D.M.C., lived in the area for some time before moving to New Jersey.\\nBob Saffer was a songwriter who wrote the campaign songs for presidents John F.

Of these counties only the western two thirds of San Diego, most of Los Angeles and all of Orange are included.\\nHowever, some sources include the coastal half of Ventura, western part of Riverside, and southwestern part of San Bernardino Counties because of their proximity to the Pacific Coast and because they are in the same bio-region and watershed.\\n\\n\\n== South Coast culture ==\\nThe South Coast is a very popular area with tourists and is the home base for Hollywood and the entertainment industry. Many amusement parks such as Disneyland, Legoland, and SeaWorld are located in the area. Beach culture is very prominent in the region and residents and tourist alike engage in many water sports such as surfing and bodyboarding. Famous beaches and resort towns include Malibu, Santa Monica, the Beach Cities, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Del Mar, La Jolla, Pacific Beach, and Coronado. The area is also a very popular fashion location, anchoring the west coast in the fashion industry.\\nMany television shows such as The Hills, Beverly Hills, 90210, Laguna Beach, The OC, 90210 and Melrose Place have helped popularize the region and its districts, depicting stereotypical SoCoast and SoCal living.\\nJust as the region is known for its entertainment and nightlife, so is it known for its colleges, universities and involvement in the military and research sectors. The area also features many museums, zoos, wildlife parks and refuges.\\n\\n\\n== Smuggling ==\\nDuring the prohibition era the waters of the South Coast were a popular smuggling route in for alcohol. Largely forgotten in the later parts of the 20th Century, with increased security at the Mexico\\u2013United States border smuggling has increased; during the 2011 fiscal year, more than 200 smuggling vessels were observed. Most of the vessels attempt to off load their cargo of drugs and/or illegal immigrants in San Diego County, however destinations are as far north as the California Central Coast. Often, vessels used for smuggling operations are abandoned upon making landfall.\\n\\n\\n== Location and region ==\\nThe South Coast has a Mediterranean climate. That means the seasons consist of warm summers, mild wet winters, cool pleasant falls, and warm springs. Summers do not get extremely hot because the ocean serves as a coastal climate mediator, nor do the winters ever get extremely cold.

While much of the neighborhood is residential, Downtown Flushing, centered on the northern end of Main Street, is a large commercial and retail area and is the fourth largest central business district in New York City.\\nFlushing\\'s diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside there, including people of Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, European, and African American ancestry. It is part of the Fifth Congressional District, which encompasses the entire northeastern shore of Queens County, and extends into neighboring Nassau County. Flushing is served by five railroad stations on the Long Island Rail Road Port Washington Branch, as well as the New York City Subway\\'s IRT Flushing Line (7 <7> trains), which has its terminus at Main Street. The intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue is the third busiest intersection in New York City, behind Times and Herald Squares.\\nFlushing is part of Queens Community Board 7 and is bounded by Flushing Meadows\\u2013Corona Park to the west, Utopia Parkway to the east, the Long island Expressway to the south, and Willets Point Boulevard to the north.\\nZIP codes beginning with 113 are administered from a sectional center at Flushing Post Office. The 113-prefixed area extends west into Jackson Heights, southwest into Ridgewood, south into Forest Hills, and east into Little Neck.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Dutch colony ===\\nIn 1645, Flushing was established by Dutch settlers on the eastern bank of Flushing Creek under charter of the Dutch West India Company and was part of the New Netherland colony. The settlement was named after the city of Vlissingen, in the southwestern Netherlands, the main port of the company; Flushing is an anglicization of the Dutch name that was then in use.\\nIn its early days, Flushing was inhabited by English colonists, among them a farmer named John Bowne, who defied a prohibition imposed by New Amsterdam Director-General Peter Stuyvesant on harboring Quakers, by allowing Quaker meetings in his home. The Flushing Remonstrance, signed in Flushing on December 27, 1657, protested religious persecution and eventually led to the decision by the Dutch West India Company to allow Quakers and others to worship freely. As such, Flushing is claimed to be a birthplace of religious freedom in the new world.\\nLandmarks remaining from the Dutch period in Flushing include the John Bowne House on Bowne Street and the Old Quaker Meeting House on Northern Boulevard.\\n\\n\\n=== English colonial history ===\\nIn 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam, ending Dutch control of the colony, and renamed it the Province of New York. When Queens County was established in 1683, the \"Town of Flushing\" was one of the original five towns which comprised the county. Many historical references to Flushing are to this town, bounded from Newtown on the west by Flushing Creek (now Flushing River), from Jamaica on the south by the watershed, and from Hempstead on the east by what later became the Nassau County line. The town was dissolved in 1898 when Queens became a borough of New York City, and the term \"Flushing\" today usually refers to a much smaller area, for example the former Village of Flushing.\\nFlushing was the site of the first commercial tree nurseries in North America, the most prominent being the Prince, Bloodgood, and Parsons nurseries. Much of the northern section of Kissena Park, former site of the Parsons nursery, still contains a wide variety of exotic trees. The naming of streets intersecting Kissena Boulevard on its way toward Kissena Park celebrates this fact (Ash Avenue, Beech, Cherry ...Poplar, Quince, Rose). Flushing also supplied trees to the Greensward project, now known as Central Park in Manhattan.\\nDuring the American Revolution, Flushing, along with most settlements in present-day Queens County, favored the British and quartered British troops, though one battalion of Scottish Highlanders is known to have been stationed at Flushing during the war. Following the Battle of Long Island, Nathan Hale, an officer in the Continental Army, was apprehended near Flushing Bay while on what was probably an intelligence gathering mission and was later hanged.\\nThe 1785 Kingsland Homestead, originally the residence of a wealthy Quaker merchant, now serves as the home of the Queens Historical Society.\\n\\n\\n=== Nineteenth century ===\\nDuring the 19th century, as New York City continued to grow in population and economic vitality, so did Flushing. Its proximity to Manhattan was critical in its transformation into a fashionable residential area. In 1813, the Village of Flushing was incorporated within the Town of Flushing. By the mid-1860s, Queens County had 30,429 residents. Flushing\\'s growth continued with two new villages incorporating: College Point in 1867, and Whitestone in 1868. In 1898, although opposed to the proposal, the Town of Flushing (along with two other towns of Queens County) was consolidated into the City of New York to form the new Borough of Queens. All towns, villages, and cities within the new borough were dissolved. Local farmland continued to be subdivided and developed transforming Flushing into a densely populated neighborhood of New York City.\\n\\n\\n=== Twentieth century development ===\\nThe continued construction of bridges over the Flushing River and the development of other roads increased the volume of vehicular traffic into Flushing. In 1909, the construction of the Queensboro Bridge (also known as the 59th Street Bridge) over the East River connected Queens County to midtown Manhattan.\\nThe introduction of rail road service to Manhattan in 1910 by the Long Island Rail Road Port Washington Branch and in 1928 by the New York City Subway\\'s IRT Flushing Line (7 <7> trains) hastened the continued transformation of Flushing to a commuter suburb and commercial center. Due to increased traffic, a main roadway through Flushing named Broadway was widened and renamed Northern Boulevard.\\nFlushing was a forerunner of Hollywood, when the young American film industry was still based on the U.S. East Coast and Chicago. Decades later, the RKO Keith\\'s movie palace would host vaudeville acts and appearances by the likes of Mickey Rooney, The Marx Brothers and Bob Hope. The theater now lies vacant and in disrepair due to an unauthorized real estate development project that took place in the early 1990s.\\n\\n\\n=== Emerging Chinese communities ===\\n\\n\\n==== Emergence As Little Taipei(\\u5c0f\\u53f0\\u5317) / Little Taiwan(\\u5c0f\\u53f0\\u7063) ====\\nIn the 1970s, a Chinese community established a foothold in the neighborhood of Flushing, whose demographic constituency had been predominantly non-Hispanic white, interspersed with a small Japanese community. This wave of immigrants from Taiwan were the first to arrive and developed Flushing\\'s Chinatown. It was known as Little Taipei (\\u5c0f\\u53f0\\u5317) or Little Taiwan (\\u5c0f\\u53f0\\u7063). Many who arrived were the descendants of former soldiers and political supporters of Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese Nationalist Party, which had lost the war against the Communist Party of China, and established themselves in Taiwan. Along with immigrants from Taiwan at this time, a large South Korean population also called Flushing home.\\nBefore the 1970s, Cantonese immigrants had vastly dominated Chinese immigration to New York City; however during the 1970s, the Taiwanese immigrants were the first wave of Chinese immigrants who spoke Mandarin rather than Cantonese to arrive in New York City. Due to the dominance of Cantonese-speaking immigrants, who were largely working-class in Manhattan\\'s Chinatown (\\u7d10\\u7d04\\u83ef\\u57e0), as well as the language barrier and poor housing conditions there, Taiwanese immigrants, who were more likely to have attained higher educational standards and socioeconomic status, could not relate to Manhattan\\'s Chinatown, and chose to settle in Flushing instead.\\nAs the Taiwanese population grew, a Flushing Chinatown was created with a higher standard of living and better housing conditions.\\n\\n\\n==== Mandarin Town, Flushing (\\u570b\\u8a9e\\u57e0, \\u6cd5\\u62c9\\u76db\\u83ef\\u57e0) ====\\nOver the years, many new non-Cantonese ethnic Chinese immigrants from different regions and provinces of China started to arrive in New York City. This led to the creation of a more Mandarin-speaking Chinatown or Mandarin Town (\\u570b\\u8a9e\\u57e0) that gradually replaced Little Taipei. This wave of immigrants spoke Mandarin and various regional/provincial dialects. Like the Taiwanese, they faced cultural and communication problems in Manhattan\\'s Cantonese-speaking Chinatown and settled in Flushing as well as Elmhurst, Queens, which also has a significant Mandarin-speaking population. Flushing\\'s Chinese population became very diverse over the next few decades as people from different provinces started to arrive, infusing their varied languages and cultures into its Chinatown.\\nFlushing and its Chinatown abuts the rapidly growing Long Island Koreatown (\\ub871 \\uc544\\uc77c\\ub79c\\ub4dc \\ucf54\\ub9ac\\uc544\\ud0c0\\uc6b4) as well.\\n\\n\\n== Sections of Flushing ==\\n\\n\\n=== Chinatown, Flushing (\\u6cd5\\u62c9\\u76db\\u83ef\\u57e0) ===\\n\\nFlushing Chinatown (\\u6cd5\\u62c9\\u76db\\u83ef\\u57e0), or Mandarin Town (\\u570b\\u8a9e\\u57e0) is one of the largest and fastest growing ethnic Chinese enclaves outside of Asia, as well as within New York City itself. In Mandarin, Flushing is known as \"Falasheng\" (Chinese: \\u6cd5\\u62c9\\u76db; pinyin: F\\u01cel\\u0101sh\\xe8ng).\\nMain Street and the area to its west, particularly along Roosevelt Avenue, have become the primary nexus of Flushing\\'s Chinatown. However, Chinatown continues to expand southeastward along Kissena Boulevard and northward beyond Northern Boulevard. In the 1970s, a Chinese community established a foothold in the neighborhood of Flushing, whose demographic constituency had been predominantly non-Hispanic white. Taiwanese began the surge of immigration, followed by other groups of Chinese. By 1990, Asians constituted 41% of the population of the core area of Flushing, with Chinese in turn representing 41% of the Asian population. However, ethnic Chinese are constituting an increasingly dominant proportion of the Asian population as well as of the overall population in Flushing and its Chinatown. A 1986 estimate by the Flushing Chinese Business Association approximated 60,000 Chinese in Flushing alone.\\n\\n\\n==== Chinese demographic ====\\nThe intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, the business center for Flushing, on the westernmost edge of the neighborhood, has a large concentration of Chinese and Korean businesses, including Asian restaurants. Chinese-owned businesses in particular dominate the area along Main Street and the blocks west of it. Many of the signs and advertisements of the stores in the area are in Chinese. Ethnic Chinese constitute an increasingly dominant proportion of the Asian population and as well as of the overall population in Flushing. Consequently, Flushing\\'s Chinatown has grown rapidly enough to become the second-largest Chinatown outside of Asia. In fact, the Flushing Chinatown may surpass the original Manhattan Chinatown itself within a few years.\\nA 1986 estimate by the Flushing Chinese Business Association approximated 60,000 Chinese in Flushing alone. By 1990, Asians constituted 41% of the population of the core area of Flushing, with Chinese in turn representing 41% of the Asian population. However, ethnic Chinese are constituting an increasingly dominant proportion of the Asian population as well as of the overall population in Flushing and its Chinatown. High rates of both legal and illegal immigration from Mainland China continue to spur the ongoing rise of the ethnic Chinese population in Flushing, as in all of New York City\\'s Chinatowns.\\nAccording to a Daily News article, Flushing\\'s Chinatown ranks as New York City\\'s second largest Chinese community with 33,526 Chinese, up from 17,363, a 93% increase. The Brooklyn Chinatown (\\u5e03\\u9c81\\u514b\\u6797\\u83ef\\u57e0) now ranks #1 as the largest Chinatown of NYC with 34,218 Chinese residents, up from 19,963 in 2000, a 71% increase. As for Manhattan\\'s Chinatown, its Chinese population declined by 17%, from 34,554 to 28,681 since 2000 to rank #3.\\n\\n\\n==== Culture ====\\n\\nFlushing now rivals Manhattan\\'s Chinatown as a center of Chinese culture and has been called the \"Chinese Manhattan\". The Lunar New Year Parade has become a growing annual celebration of Chinese New Year. More and larger Chinese supermarkets are locating and selling a diverse and uniquely vast array of Chinese food and ingredient selections in Flushing, the largest of which include Hong Kong Supermarket and New York Supermarket, which also happen to be rapidly growing Chinese American chain supermarkets. Flushing\\'s rise as an epicenter of Chinese culture outside of Asia has been attributed to the remarkable diversity of regional Chinese demographics represented.\\nThe World Journal, one of the largest Chinese-language newspapers outside of China, is headquartered in adjacent Whitestone (\\u767d\\u77f3), Queens, with offices in Flushing as well. Numerous other Chinese- and English-language publications are available in Flushing.\\nThe popular styles of Chinese cuisine are ubiquitously accessible in Flushing, including Taiwanese, Shanghainese, Hunanese, Szechuan, Cantonese, Fujianese, Xinjiang, Zhejiang, and Korean Chinese cuisine. Even the relatively obscure Dongbei style of cuisine indigenous to Northeast China is now available in Flushing, as well as Mongolian cuisine.\\nMandarin Chinese (including Northeastern Mandarin), Fuzhou dialect, Min Nan Fujianese, Wu Chinese, Beijing dialect, Wenzhounese, Shanghainese, Suzhou dialect, Hangzhou dialect, Cantonese, Taiwanese, and English are all prevalently spoken in Flushing Chinatown, while the Mongolian language is now emerging. Even the relatively obscure Dongbei style of cuisine indigenous to Northeast China is now available in Flushing . Given its rapidly growing status, the Flushing Chinatown may surpass in size and population the original New York City Chinatown in the borough of Manhattan within a few years, and it is debatable whether this has already happened. The New York Times says that Flushing\\'s Chinatown now rivals Manhattan\\'s Chinatown for being the center of Chinese-speaking New Yorkers\\' politics and trade.\\nIn accompaniment with its rapid growth, Flushing in particular has witnessed the proliferation of highly competitive businesses touted as educational centers as well as non-profit organizations declaring the intent to educate the community. Some entities offer education in Mandarin, the lingua franca of Mainland China; others profess to provide students with intensive training in computer and technological proficiency; while still others entice high school students with rigorous preparatory classes for college entrance examinations in mathematics, science, and English literacy.\\nA diverse array of social services geared toward assisting recent as well as established Chinese immigrants is readily available in Flushing.\\n\\n\\n==== Satellite Chinatowns ====\\nThe Elmhurst Chinatown on Broadway in nearby Elmhurst, another neighborhood in the borough of Queens, also has a large and rapidly growing Chinese community and is developing as a satellite of the Flushing Chinatown. Previously a small area with Chinese shops on Broadway between 81st Street and Cornish Avenue, this newly evolved second Chinatown in Queens has now expanded to 45th Avenue and Whitney Avenue.\\nA third and fledgling Chinatown is now emerging in Queens, geographically between Flushing and Elmhurst, in the neighborhood of Corona.\\n\\n\\n=== Koreatown (\\ub871 \\uc544\\uc77c\\ub79c\\ub4dc \\ucf54\\ub9ac\\uc544\\ud0c0\\uc6b4) ===\\n\\nThere is a Koreatown which originated in Flushing, but has since spread eastward to Murray Hill, Bayside, Douglaston, and Little Neck in Queens, and also into Nassau County. As of the 2010 United States Census, the Korean population of Queens was 64,107.\\n\\n\\n==== History ====\\nIn the 1980s, a continuous stream of Korean immigrants emerged into the Long Island Koreatown, many of whom began as workers in the medical field or Korean international students who had moved to New York City to find or initiate professional or entrepreneurial positions. They established a foothold on Union Street in Flushing between 35th and 41st Avenues, featuring restaurants and karaoke (noraebang) bars, grocery markets, education centers and bookstores, banking institutions, offices, consumer electronics vendors, apparel boutiques, and other commercial enterprises.\\nAs the community grew in wealth and population and rose in socioeconomic status, Koreans expanded their presence eastward along Northern Boulevard, buying homes in more affluent and less crowded Queens neighborhoods and more recently into adjacent suburban Nassau County, bringing their businesses with them, and thereby expanding the Koreatown itself. This expansion has led to the creation of an American Meokjagolmok, or Korean Restaurant Street, around the Long Island Railroad station in Murray Hill, Queens, exuding the ambience of Seoul itself. The eastward pressure to expand was also created by the inability to move westward, inhibited by the formidable presence of the enormous Flushing Chinatown (\\u6cd5\\u62c9\\u76db\\u83ef\\u57e0) centered on Main Street.\\nPer the 2010 United States Census, the Korean population of Queens was 64,107, representing the largest municipality in the United States with a density of at least 500 Korean Americans per square mile; while the Korean population of Nassau County had increased by nearly two-thirds to approximately 14,000 over one decade since the 2000 Census. Along with the two Koreatowns of Bergen County, New Jersey (in Palisades Park and Fort Lee) and the Manhattan Koreatown in New York City, the Long Island Koreatown functions as a satellite node for an overall Korean American population of 218,764 individuals in the New York City Metropolitan Area, the second largest population of ethnic Koreans outside of Korea. Korean Air and Asiana Airlines provide non-stop flights from Seoul to JFK Airport in Queens.\\n\\n\\n==== Culture ====\\nThe Korea Times, a news organization based in Seoul, carries a significant presence in the Long Island Koreatown.\\nThe Long Island Koreatown features numerous restaurants that serve both traditional and/or regional Korean cuisine. As noted above, the development of this Koreatown has led to the creation of an American Meokjagolmok, or Korean Restaurant Street, around the Long Island Rail Road station in Murray Hill, exuding the ambience of Seoul itself. Korean Chinese cuisine is now also available in Koreatown.\\nKorean and English are both spoken prevalently. Retail signs employing the Hangul alphabet are ubiquitous.\\nA significant array of social services toward assisting recent and established Korean immigrants is readily available in Koreatown.\\n\\n\\n=== Other ethnic communities ===\\n\\nThe neighborhood of East Flushing, technically within Greater Flushing, also houses a substantial Chinese community along with most of Downtown Flushing. However, East Flushing also substantially includes Irish, Greek, Russian, and Italian communities, as well as communities of Indians, Sri Lankans, Malaysians, and Hispanics, mostly Colombians and Salvadorans. This neighborhood tends to be more diverse visibly than Downtown Flushing because of the more even distribution of the ethnicities of East Flushing residents resulting in more businesses catering to each community rather than the dominance of Chinese and to a lesser extent Korean businesses in Downtown Flushing.\\nThe northeastern section of Flushing near Bayside continues to maintain large Italian and Greek presences that are reflected in its many Italian and Greek bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants. The northwest is a mix of Jews, Greeks, and Italians. Most of central Flushing is an ethnic mix of Whites, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans.\\nAn area south of Franklin Avenue houses a concentration of Indian, Pakistani, Afghan, and Bangladeshi markets. This concentration of South Asian businesses south of Franklin Avenue has existed since the late 1970s, one of the oldest Little Indias in North America. The Sri Maha Vallabha Ganapati Devasthanam (Sanskrit: \\u0936\\u094d\\u0930\\u0940 \\u092e\\u0939\\u093e\\u0935\\u0932\\u094d\\u0932\\u092d \\u0917\\u0923\\u092a\\u0924\\u093f \\u0926\\u0947\\u0935\\u0938\\u094d\\u0925\\u093e\\u0928\\u092e\\u094d, Tamil: \\u0bb8\\u0bcd\\u0bb0\\u0bc0 \\u0bae\\u0b95\\u0bbe \\u0bb5\\u0bb2\\u0bcd\\u0bb2\\u0baa \\u0b95\\u0ba3\\u0baa\\u0ba4\\u0bbf \\u0ba4\\u0bc7\\u0bb5\\u0bb8\\u0bcd\\u0ba4\\u0bbe\\u0ba9\\u0bae\\u0bcd) at 45-57 Bowne Street in Flushing was the very first of the traditional Hindu temples in the US.\\n\\n\\n=== Named subsections ===\\n\\n\\n==== Auburndale ====\\nAuburndale is an upper-middle-class neighborhood that is part of Queens Community Board 11 and in Murray Hill. The name comes from Auburndale, Massachusetts, the home of L. H. Green who developed the community starting in 1901, when the Long Island Railroad started offering train service to the area. The area is the site of the Long Island Rail Road\\'s Auburndale station.\\nThe most common style of house in Auburndale is the Tudor. The Auburndale Improvement Association, along with other groups, seeks \"to preserve the neighborhood\\'s small-scale, lawns-and-driveways character, which in some respects seems to have more in common with nearby suburban Nassau County than New York.\" Along with Tudors, capacious Dutch colonials and Cape Cod houses also abound. Home prices range from $499,000 to roughly $1.5 million, averaging at around $650,000. Queens Borough Public Library operates the Auburndale Branch in the area.\\n\\n\\n==== Broadway-Flushing ====\\nBroadway-Flushing, also known as North Flushing, is a residential area with many large homes. Part of this area has been designated a State and Federal historic district due to the elegant, park-like character of the neighborhood. Recently much of the area was rezoned by the City of New York to preserve the low density, residential quality of the area. The neighborhood awaits designation as an Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Broadway-Flushing is bounded by 29th Avenue to the north, Northern Boulevard and Crocheron Avenue to the south, 155th Street to the west, and 172nd Streets to the east.\\n\\n\\n==== Linden Hill ====\\nLinden Hill is part of Flushing and is served by the NYPD\\'s 109th Precinct and Queens Community Board 7. Its borders are defined as 25th Avenue to Willets Point Boulevard. to the north, 154th Street to the east, Northern Boulevard to the south and the Whitestone Expressway to the west.\\nLinden Hill was originally a rural estate owned by the Mitchell family. Ernest Mitchell owned an adjacent area known as Breezy Hill and his father owned the area now called Linden Hill. The two areas are sometimes referred to as Mitchell-Linden. A major change in the rural nature of Linden Hill occurred in 1950. Builders envisioned a cooperative project to be set on Linden Hill which would provide middle-income housing to veterans of World War II and Korea. Under Section 213 of the Federal Housing Act of 1950, and at a cost of $15 million, the project was enacted. It providing homes for about 1400 residents.\\nOnce a primarily European-American neighborhood, Linden Hill is now a diverse mix of European-Americans, Asian-Americans and Latino-Americans. The Asian-American population has expanded markedly in the southern part of Linden Hill in the past decade (as it has in Flushing proper) and the Latino-American population has also grown noticeably. Conversely, the European-American population has lessened somewhat, though European-Americans still remain in great numbers north of Bayside Avenue, west of 149th Street, and in the co-operative apartments at Mitchell Gardens, Linden Towers, Embassy Arms, and Linden Hills.\\nThe local branch of the Queens Borough Public Library is located on Union Street and is known as the Mitchell Linden Branch.\\n\\n\\n==== Murray Hill ====\\nThis subsection has a median income of $38,978 and ZIP codes of 11354, 11355, and 11358. Traditionally the home of families of Irish and Italian immigrants, many Korean and Chinese immigrants have moved into Murray Hill in recent years. Murray Hill is often confused with the larger Murray Hill neighborhood on the East Side of Manhattan.\\nBefore the area was developed for residential housing in 1889, Murray Hill was the location of several large nurseries owned by the King, Murray, and Parsons families. The Kingsland Homestead has been preserved as the home of the Queens Historical Society. The Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden is also located in Murray Hill.\\nComic strip artist Richard F. Outcault, the creator of The Yellow Kid and Buster Brown, lived on 147th Street in Murray Hill.\\n\\n\\n==== Queensboro Hill ====\\nQueensboro Hill in southern Flushing is bordered to the West by College Point Boulevard, to the North by Kissena Park and Kissena Corridor Park, to the South by Reeves Avenue and the Long Island Expressway, and to the East by Fresh Meadow Lane. Queensboro Hill is a part of ZIP codes 11355 and 11367 and contains a New York Hospital Queens branch. One of the leading churches is the Queensboro Hill Community Church, a multi-racial congregation of the Reformed Church in America.\\nThis area is often referred to as South Flushing. This may also refer to Pomonok.\\n\\n\\n==== Waldheim ====\\nThe Waldheim neighborhood, an estate subdivision in Flushing constructed primarily between 1875 and 1925, is a small district of high quality \"in-town\" suburban architecture that preservationists have tried to save for at least twenty-five years. Waldheim, German for \"home in the woods\", known for its large homes of varying architectural styles, laid out in an unusual street pattern, was the home of some of Flushing\\'s wealthiest residents until the 1960s. Notable residents include the Helmann family of condiment fame, the Steinway family of piano notability, as well as A. Douglas Nash, who managed a nearby Tiffany glass plant. The neighborhood was rezoned by the City of New York in 2008, in order to halt the destruction of its original housing stock, which began in the late 1980s, and to help preserve the low density, residential character of the neighborhood. As with the Broadway neighborhood, preservationists have been unable to secure designation as an Historic District by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission to date. Today, Waldheim stretches between Sanford and Franklin Avenues on the north, 45th Avenue on the south, Bowne Street on the west and Parsons Boulevard on the east. The area is immediately southeast of the downtown Flushing commercial core, and adjacent to Kissena Park.\\n\\n\\n== Places ==\\n\\n\\n=== Houses of worship ===\\n\\nFlushing is among the most religiously diverse communities in America. Today, Flushing abounds with houses of worship, ranging from the Dutch colonial epoch Quaker Meeting House, the historic Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Queens, St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church, St. George\\'s Episcopal Church, the Free Synagogue of Flushing, the Congregation of Georgian Jews, St. Mel Roman Catholic Church, St. Michael\\'s Catholic Church, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Shrine Church, St. John\\'s Lutheran Church, Queensboro Hill Community Church, Hindu Temple Society of North America, and the Muslim Center of New York.\\nThere are \"over 200 places of worship in a small urban neighborhood about 2.5 square miles (6.3 square kilometers).\" \"Flushing has become a model for religious pluralism in America, says R. Scott Hanson, a visiting assistant professor of history at the State University of New York at Binghamton and an affiliate of the Pluralism Project at Harvard University.\"\\nIn 1657, while Flushing was still a Dutch settlement, a document known as the Flushing Remonstrance was created by Edward Hart, the town clerk, where some thirty ordinary citizens protested a ban imposed by Peter Stuyvesant, the director general of New Amsterdam, forbidding the harboring of Quakers. The Remonstrants cited the Flushing Town charter of 1645 which promised liberty of conscience.\\n\\n\\n=== Landmarks, museums, and cultural institutions ===\\n\\nFlushing has many landmark buildings. Flushing Town Hall on Northern Boulevard is the headquarters of the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts, an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

The Flushing Armory, on Northern Boulevard, was formerly used by the National Guard. Presently, the Queens North Task Force of the New York City Police Department uses this building. In 2005, the Fitzgerald-Ginsberg Mansion on Bayside Avenue and in 2007, the Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden were designated as landmarks.\\nSeveral attractions were originally developed for the World\\'s Fairs in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. There is a stone marker for the two 5,000-year Westinghouse Time Capsules made of special alloys buried in the park, chronicling 20th-century life in the United States, dedicated both in 1938 and 1965. Also in the park are the Queens Museum of Art which features a scale model of the City of New York, the largest architectural model ever built; Queens Theatre in the Park; the New York Hall of Science and the Queens Zoo.\\nThe Queens Botanical Garden on Main Street has been in operation continuously since its opening as an exhibit at the 1939 World\\'s Fair.

Established in 2001 by Jeffrey Carpenter, it is located on Liberty Avenue in Pittsburgh\\'s Cultural District in a space that was formerly a Turkish bathhouse. The company\\'s mission is to use Pittsburgh\\'s \"distinctive resources\" to create theatre that \"stimulate[s] a heightened sense of involvement for the audience.\" Bricolage has held readings and staged productions of numerous new works by playwrights on the Pittsburgh, national, and international theatre scene. Also part of their season are Midnight Radio, a series of live performances of radio scripts performed in front of an audience, and B.U.S. (Bricolage Urban Scrawl), an event in which playwrights, directors, and actors create productions of original short plays within a span of 24 hours. Bricolage has also acted as a host space for other performers and events, such as singer Daphne Alderson, comedian Gab Bonesso, performance artists Roberto Sifuentes and Guillermo Gomez-Pena, and a PlaySlam hosted by the Dramatists Guild. In 2010, the company introduced an arts education program entitled \"Walk the Talk\" in conjunction with its production of Speech and Debate.

The term\\'s historic usage has been in reference to World Series games played between New York teams. The New York Yankees have appeared in all Subway Series games as they have been the only American League team in the city, and have compiled an 11\\u20133 record in the fourteen championship Subway Series. Since 1997, the term Subway Series has also been applied informally to interleague play during the regular season between the Yankees and National League New York Mets, although the term is still most commonly associated with World Series play.\\n\\n\\n== 19th century Trolley Series ==\\n\\nAlthough organized games between all-stars from New York teams against all-stars from Brooklyn teams date back to the 1850s, the first actual New York-Brooklyn \"World Championship Series\" occurred in 1889, a full nine years before Brooklyn was incorporated into the City of New York by the Greater New York Act of 1898, when the New York Giants squared off against (and defeated) the Brooklyn Bridegrooms, also called the \"Trolley Dodgers\", of the American Association. The following season, Brooklyn withdrew from the Association and joined the League, setting the stage for many future intra-city competitions.\\nSome might argue that the 1889 Series would qualify as a \"Trolley Series\", but would not qualify as a Subway Series since New York\\'s subway did not open until 1904.\\n\\n\\n== Early-mid 20th century Subway Series ==\\nBy the 1920s, the subway had become an important form of public transport in the city and provided a convenient form of travel between the three city ballparks: the Polo Grounds, in upper Manhattan; Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx; and Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. The 155th Street elevated and subway stations, the 161st Street station, and the Atlantic Ave respectively, served the ballparks. (New York\\'s subway and elevated systems\\u2014the IRT, BRT/BMT, and IND\\u2014were in competition with each other until 1940.)\\nIn the case of the World Series contests listed, the entire Series could be attended by using the subway. The date of the first usage of the term \"Subway Series\" is uncertain. The term \"Nickel Series\" (a nickel was the old subway fare) appeared in newspapers by 1927, and \"Subway Series\" appeared by 1928. \"Subway Series\" was clearly already a familiar concept by 1934, as discussed in this article about that year\\'s All-Star Game to be held in New York, discussing the \"subway series\" possibility for the Giants and Yankees. (Ultimately, no New York team made it to the 1934 post-season.).\\n\\n\\n=== Yankees-Giants ===\\n\\nThe 1921 and 1922 match-ups were played in a single ballpark, as both the Giants and Yankees then played at the Polo Grounds. The Giants won the first two Subway Series played. Despite cordial relations just a few years before when the Yankees allowed the Giants to share their home at Hilltop Park, the Yankees were issued an eviction notice after the 1921 contest and opened their new ballpark in 1923. Fortunes would change for the Yankees as they defeated the Giants this time in the 3rd straight year of World Series competition between the two. Their new home would host the Yankees\\' first of 11 Subway World Series victories that year and first of an unprecedented 26 World Series until the stadium closed in 2008.\\nThe venues for the 1923, 1936, 1937, and 1951 World Series - the Polo Grounds and the old Yankee Stadium - were a short walk apart across the Macombs Dam Bridge over the Harlem River. Of course, anyone in the city not living in that vicinity could have opted for the subway system.\\n\\n\\n=== Yankees-Dodgers ===\\n\\nThe term was used again in 1941 when the Dodgers made their first World Series appearance since 1920. Multiple Hall of Famers took part in these contests between the \"Bronx Bombers\" and \"Dem Bums from Brooklyn\" and the games involved numerous achievements including Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier as the first African-American baseball player in the World Series and Don Larsen\\'s performance in pitching the only perfect game in post-season history. The seven matchups between the Yankees and the Dodgers between 1941 and 1956 cemented the term as being mostly associated with the New York vs. Brooklyn contests, during the time when New York City was retroactively dubbed by historians as \"The Capital of Baseball\". Despite Brooklyn\\'s repeated success at winning the National League pennant, they were only able to win one World Series (1955) against the Yankees.\\n\\n\\n=== World Series Matchups ===\\nThe all-New York match-ups in World Series play during this period been the following:\\n1921 - New York Giants defeat New York Yankees, 5-3.\\n1922 - New York Giants defeat New York Yankees, 4-0-1.\\n1923 - New York Yankees defeat New York Giants, 4-2.\\n1936 - New York Yankees defeat New York Giants, 4-2.\\n1937 - New York Yankees defeat New York Giants, 4-1.\\n1941 - New York Yankees defeat Brooklyn Dodgers, 4-1.\\n1947 - New York Yankees defeat Brooklyn Dodgers, 4-3.\\n1949 - New York Yankees defeat Brooklyn Dodgers, 4-1.\\n1951 - New York Yankees defeat New York Giants, 4-2.\\n1952 - New York Yankees defeat Brooklyn Dodgers, 4-3.\\n1953 - New York Yankees defeat Brooklyn Dodgers, 4-1.\\n1955 - Brooklyn Dodgers defeat New York Yankees, 4-3.\\n1956 - New York Yankees defeat Brooklyn Dodgers, 4-3.\\n2000 - New York Yankees defeat New York Mets, 4-1.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibition series ==\\n\\nIn addition to the five World Series played between the Yankees and Giants prior to 1940, the two teams also played exhibition series against each other from time to time. The match-ups were known as the \"City Series\" and were sometimes played in October while other teams played in the World Series. However, after 1940, this became difficult because the Yankees would routinely appear in the World Series. In the seventeen-year span of 1941 through 1957 (after which the Giants and Dodgers left New York City for California), the Yankees appeared in the World Series twelve times, failing to reach the Series only in 1944, 1945, 1946, 1948, and 1954.\\nPrior to the abandonment of New York City by the city\\'s two National League teams, the Yankees and Dodgers played an annual midseason exhibition game called the Mayor\\'s Trophy Game to benefit sandlot baseball in New York City, with the proceeds raised by the Yankees going to leagues in Manhattan and the Bronx while proceeds raised by the Dodgers going to leagues on Long Island and Staten Island. The annual charity event was discontinued following the 1957 season when the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles and the Giants moved to San Francisco. With that, the Yankees became the only major league team in the city, but it was revived in 1963 after the National League returned to New York with the expansion New York Mets in 1962. After dwinding interest and public bickering between the owners of both teams, the Mayor\\'s Trophy Game was discontinued following the 1983 season. It was revived again as a pre-Opening Day series titled the \"Mayor\\'s Challenge\" and held in 1989.\\n\\n\\n== Modern usage ==\\n\\nIn modern usage, the term \"Subway Series\" generally refers to a series played between the two current New York baseball teams, the New York Yankees and the New York Mets. Their stadiums remain directly accessible by subway: Yankee Stadium via the 161st Street station; Citi Field via the Willets Point station.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000 World Series ===\\n\\nThe name \"Subway Series\" was commonly applied to the 2000 World Series between the New York Yankees and the New York Mets. The Yankees won four games to one and celebrated their 26th championship in front of Mets fans at Shea Stadium. This was the only time that visiting teams had ever won a World Series at Shea Stadium. The other two times the World Series ended at Shea Stadium, in 1969 and 1986, it ended with the Mets winning.\\nDuring the 2000 World Series, the City of New York decorated some of the trains that ran on the 7 train (which went to Shea Stadium in Queens, home of the Mets) and 4 train (which went to the old Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, home of the Yankees). The 7 trains were blue and orange and featured the Mets version of the \"NY\" logo, and the 4 trains were white with blue pinstripes and featured the Yankees version of the \"NY\" logo. Also, after each game in the series the city offered free subway rides home for attendees of the game. Yankee fans displayed signs that read \"Yankees in 4 and not in 7\", predicting that the Yankees would easily dispatch the Mets in a Series sweep as opposed to a difficult, full-length Series. The signs had the 4 in a dark green circle designating the number 4 train and the 7 in a purple circle, designating the number 7 train.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBay Bridge Series, Oakland Athletics vs. San Francisco Giants\\nCubs\\u2013White Sox rivalry\\nFreeway Series, Los Angeles Dogers vs. Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim\\nKnicks-Nets rivalry\\nRangers-Islanders rivalry\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n2000 Subway Series Recap on MLB.com\\nGreat Subway Series moments\\nHistory of the Subway Series from the NY Times\\nThe Subway Series (and Other Inter-Urban Series)\\nSubway Series Yankees vs. Mets history and boxscores from Newsday', u'Bill George (American football player)': u'William J. George (October 27, 1929 \\u2013 September 30, 1982) was a professional football player, playing linebacker, for the Chicago Bears and the Los Angeles Rams.\\nGeorge was born in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, about 50 miles south of Pittsburgh. He is among numerous legendary football players born in football-rich Western Pennsylvania.\\nHe attended college at Wake Forest University, and as the Bears\\' second-round draft pick in 1951. He began his pro football career the following year as a middle guard in the then-standard five-man defensive front. He was also selected to play in eight consecutive Pro Bowls from 1955-1962.\\nIt has been alleged that George was the first true middle linebacker in football and, inadvertently, the creator of the 4-3 defense. Noting during a 1954 game with the Philadelphia Eagles that his tendency to hit the center right after the snap led to the quarterback passing right over his head, he began to drop back from the line, not only enabling him to intercept and otherwise disrupt several passes from that game forward but also creating the familiar 4\\u20133 setup (four linemen and three linebackers).\\nIn addition to his 18 career interceptions, George also recovered 19 fumbles, and in 1954 scored 25 points on 13 PATs and four field goals. In 1963, he led the Bears defense when they won the NFL Championship.\\nGeorge was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1974. The Bears retired his uniform number 61. In a 1989 article, in which he named his choices for the best athletes ever to wear each uniform number from 0 to 99, Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly not only chose George for number 61, but called him \"the meanest Bear ever,\" no small thing considering the franchise\\'s long history and reputation for toughness. In 1999, he was ranked number 49 on The Sporting News\\' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. George was killed in an automobile accident in Rockford, IL on September 30, 1982.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nCarroll, Bob, Gershman, Michael, Neft, David, and Thorn, John, Total Football II: The Official Encyclopedia of the National Football League, Harper Collins, 1999, page 822.\\nHalas, George, Morgan, Gwen, and Veysey, Arthur, Halas by Halas, McGraw-Hill, 1979.\\nRand, Jonathan, Riddell Presents The Gridiron\\'s Greatest Linebackers, Sports Publishing, 2003.\\nYoumans, Gary and Youmans, Maury, \\'63, The Story of the 1963 World Champion Chicago Bears, Campbell Road Press, 2004.\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nBill George at the Pro Football Hall of Fame\\nCzuba, Ashley, Taking a Look in the Bears History Book: Bill George.

A dense fog rolled over Chicago's Soldier Field during the 2nd quarter, cutting visibility to about 15\\u201320 yards for the rest of the game. Philadelphia moved the ball effectively all day and Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham had 407 passing yards despite the low visibility; but they could not get the ball into the end zone. Many players complained that they could not see the sidelines or first-down markers. The Bears ended up winning 20\\u201312. The game eventually was named #3 on NFL Top 10's Weather Games.\\nThe game was also notable in that it involved head coaches who had been previously worked on the same staff of a Super Bowl winning team. Eagles coach Buddy Ryan had been the defense coordinator for Mike Ditka on the Bears when the team won Super Bowl XX.\\n\\n\\n== Game summary ==\\nChicago scored first with quarterback Mike Tomczak's 64-yard touchdown pass to Dennis McKinnon. The Eagles responded by driving to the Chicago 26-yard line, but kicker Luis Zendejas missed a 43-yard field goal. Philadelphia quickly got the ball back after linebacker Seth Joyner intercepted a pass from Tomczak, and this time they managed to score with Zendejas' 42-yard field goal, but only after committing two costly mistakes: twice on the drive Philadelphia had touchdowns nullified by penalties. The Bears then drove to the Eagles 33-yard line on their ensuing drive, but it stalled and kicker Kevin Butler missed a 51-yard field goal attempt, giving the ball back to Philadelphia with great field position. Randall Cunningham then led the Eagles inside Chicago's 20-yard line where Zendejas kicked a 29-yard field goal to cut the team's deficit to 7\\u20136.\\nTwo possessions later, the Bears drove 44 yards and scored with Neal Anderson's 4-yard touchdown run to give them a 14\\u20136 lead. Both teams scored another field goal before halftime, and they went into their locker rooms with Chicago leading 17\\u20139.\\nIn the third quarter, Tomczak left the game with a shoulder injury. Each team could only score a short field goal in the second half. The fog was so thick that both teams were forced to use their running game because receivers could not see the long passes thrown to them. TV and radio announcers, and the fans in the stadium had trouble seeing what was happening on the field. CBS color commentator Terry Bradshaw, who was working the game, later said he was more frustrated than at any time when he was a player. Referee Jim Tunney ended up announcing the down and distance for each play on his wireless microphone.\\nCunningham finished the game with 407 passing yards, but was unable to lead his team to a single touchdown and was intercepted 3 times. Fullback Keith Byars rushed for 34 yards and caught 9 passes for 103 yards. Tight end Keith Jackson caught 7 passes for 142 yards. Other than his 64-yard touchdown pass, Tomczak was dominated the rest of the game by the Eagles defense, completing only 10 of 20 passes for 174 yard with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. McKinnon finished the game with 4 receptions for 108 yards and a touchdown.\\n\\n\\n== Statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Individual Stats ===\\n\\n*Completions/Attempts aCarries bLongest play cReceptions dTackles eForced Fumbles fLongest field goal\\n\\n\\n== Officials ==\\nReferee: Jim Tunney (#32)\\nUmpire: Ron Botchan (#110)\\nHead Linesman: Tom Johnson (#114)\\nLine Judge: Bama Glass (#15)\\nField Judge: Jack Vaughan (#93)\\nSide Judge: Dave Parry (#64)\\nBack Judge: Tom Sifferman (#118)\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nNational Football League lore\\nNFL playoffs, 1988-89\\n50th Grey Cup\\n1974 Sun Bowl\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nTotal Football: The Official Encyclopedia of the National Football League.

With a population of of 3,792,621 as of 2010, Los Angeles is the second-largest city in the United States, after New York City, and the most populous city in California. Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, celebrity culture, traffic, and the film and television industry.\\nHistorically home to the Chumash and Tongva, Los Angeles was claimed by Juan Rodr\\xedguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542 along with the rest of what would become Alta California. The city was officially founded on September 4, 1781, by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve. It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican\\u2013American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, thereby becoming part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood.\\nThe city is the focal point of the larger Los Angeles metropolitan area and the Greater Los Angeles Area region, which contain 13 million and over 18 million people in respectively as of 2010, making it one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the world as well as the second-largest in the United States. Los Angeles is the seat of Los Angeles County, the most populated county in the United States. The city\\'s inhabitants are referred to as Angelenos.\\nNicknamed the City of Angels, Los Angeles is a global city, with strengths in business, international trade, entertainment, culture, media, fashion, science, sports, technology, education, medicine and research. It has been ranked sixth in the Global Cities Index and 9th Global Economic Power Index. The city is home to renowned institutions covering a broad range of professional and cultural fields and is one of the most substantial economic engines within the United States. The Los Angeles combined statistical area (CSA) has a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $831 billion (as of 2008), making it the third-largest in the world, after the Greater Tokyo and New York metropolitan areas. Los Angeles includes Hollywood and leads the world in the creation of television productions, video games, and recorded music; it is also one of the leaders in motion picture production. Additionally, Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1932 and 1984.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-colonial period ===\\n\\nThe Los Angeles coastal area was first settled by the Tongva (or Gabriele\\xf1os) and Chumash Native American tribes thousands of years ago. A Gabrielino settlement in the area was called iy\\xe1ang\\u1e9a (written Yang-na by the Spanish), meaning \"poison oak place\".\\nJuan Rodr\\xedguez Cabrillo, a Portuguese-born explorer, claimed the area of southern California for the Spanish Empire in 1542. Gaspar de Portol\\xe0 and Franciscan missionary Juan Cresp\\xed, reached the present site of Los Angeles on August 2, 1769.\\n\\n\\n=== Spanish period ===\\nIn 1771, Franciscan friar Jun\\xedpero Serra directed the building of the Mission San Gabriel Arc\\xe1ngel, the first mission in the area. On September 4, 1781, a group of forty-four settlers known as \"Los Pobladores\" founded the pueblo called \"El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\\xf1ora la Reina de los \\xc1ngeles del R\\xedo de Porci\\xfancula\"; in English it is \"The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels of the Porci\\xfancula River\". The Queen of the Angels is an honorific of the Virgin Mary. Two-thirds of the settlers were mestizo or mulatto with a mixture of African, indigenous and European ancestry. The settlement remained a small ranch town for decades, but by 1820, the population had increased to about 650 residents. Today, the pueblo is commemorated in the historic district of Los Angeles Pueblo Plaza and Olvera Street, the oldest part of Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n=== Mexican period ===\\nNew Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo continued as a part of Mexico. During Mexican rule, Governor P\\xedo Pico made Los Angeles Alta California\\'s regional capital.\\n\\n\\n=== American period ===\\n\\nMexican rule ended during the Mexican\\u2013American War: Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847.\\nRailroads arrived with the completion of the Southern Pacific line to Los Angeles in 1876. Oil was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892, and by 1923, the discoveries had helped California become the country\\'s largest oil producer, accounting for about one-quarter of the world\\'s petroleum output.\\nBy 1900, the population had grown to more than 102,000, putting pressure on the city\\'s water supply. The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, under the supervision of William Mulholland, assured the continued growth of the city.\\nIn 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world\\'s film industry was concentrated in L.A. The money generated by the industry kept the city insulated from much of the economic pain suffered by the rest of the country during the Great Depression. By 1930, the population surpassed one million. In 1932, the city hosted the Summer Olympics.\\nDuring World War II, Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. Calship built hundreds of Liberty Ships and Victory Ships on Terminal Island, and the Los Angeles area was the headquarters of six of the country\\'s major aircraft manufacturers (Douglas Aircraft Company, Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed, North American Aviation, Northrop Corporation, and Vultee). During the war, more aircraft were produced in one year than in all the pre-war years since the Wright brothers invented the airplane in 1903, combined. Manufacturing in Los Angeles skyrocketed, and as William S. Knudsen, of the National Defense Advisory Commission put it, \"We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible.\\nFollowing the end of World War II, Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever, sprawling into the San Fernando Valley. The expansion of the Interstate Highway System during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city\\'s electrified rail system, once the world\\'s largest.\\nThe 1960s saw race relations boil-over into the Watts Riots of 1965 which resulted in 34 deaths and over 1,000 injuries. It was the most severe riot in the city\\'s history until the Los Angeles riots of 1992. In 1969, Los Angeles became one of the birthplaces of the Internet, as the first ARPANET transmission was sent from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to SRI in Menlo Park.\\nIn 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time. Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries, the 1984 Olympics became more financially successful than any previous, and the second Olympics to turn a profit until then \\u2013 the other, according to an analysis of contemporary newspaper reports, being the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles.\\nRacial tensions erupted on April 29, 1992, with the acquittal by a Simi Valley jury of the police officers captured on videotape beating Rodney King, culminating in large-scale riots. They were the largest riots in US history causing approximately $1.3 billion in damage as well as 53 deaths and over 2,000 injuries.\\nIn 1994, the 6.7 Northridge earthquake shook the city, causing $12.5 billion in damage and 72 deaths. The century ended with the Rampart scandal, one of the most extensive documented cases of police misconduct in American history.\\nIn 2002, voters defeated efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Cityscape ===\\n\\nThe city is divided into over 80 districts and neighborhoods, many of which were incorporated places or communities that merged into the city. Generally, the city is divided into the following areas: Downtown Los Angeles, East Los Angeles and Northeast Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, the Harbor Area, Greater Hollywood, Wilshire, the Westside, and the San Fernando and Crescenta Valleys.\\n\\n\\n==== Landmarks ====\\n\\nImportant landmarks in Los Angeles include Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, Angels Flight, the Kodak Theatre, the Griffith Observatory, the Getty Center, the Getty Villa, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre, the Hollywood Sign, the Bradbury Building, Hollywood Boulevard, the Capitol Records Building, Los Angeles City Hall, the Hollywood Bowl, Battleship USS Iowa, the Watts Towers, the Staples Center, Dodger Stadium, La Placita Olvera/Olvera Street.\\n\\n\\n=== Topography ===\\n\\nThe city of Los Angeles is irregularly shaped and covers a total area of 502.7 square miles (1,302 km2), comprising 468.7 square miles (1,214 km2) of land and 34.0 square miles (88 km2) of water. The city extends for 44 miles (71 km) longitudinally and for 29 miles (47 km) latitudinally. The perimeter of the city is 342 miles (550 km).\\nLos Angeles is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city is 5,074 ft (1,547 m) Mount Lukens, located at the northeastern end of the San Fernando Valley. The eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the Mt. Washington area north of Downtown, eastern parts such as Boyle Heights, the Crenshaw district around the Baldwin Hills, and the San Pedro district.\\nThe Los Angeles River, which is largely seasonal, is the primary drainage channel. It was straightened and lined in 51 miles of concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers to act as a flood control channel. The river begins in the Canoga Park district of the city, flows east from the San Fernando Valley along the north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, and turns south through the city center, flowing to its mouth in the Port of Long Beach at the Pacific Ocean. The smaller Ballona Creek flows into the Santa Monica Bay at Playa del Rey.\\nThe Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains. The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral. Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and Giant Wildrye. Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered. Though it is not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the Coral Tree (Erythrina caffra) and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia reginae). Mexican Fan Palms, Canary Island Palms, and California Fan Palms are common in the Los Angeles area, although only the last is native.\\n\\n\\n=== Geology ===\\nLos Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability has produced numerous faults, which cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes annually in Southern California, though most of them are too small to be felt. One of the major faults is the San Andreas Fault. Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is vulnerable to the \"big one,\" a megathrust earthquake anticipated to inevitably strike the Cascadia subduction zone and eventually striking California through the San Andreas fault. Major earthquakes that have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt. The Los Angeles basin and metropolitan area are also at risk from blind thrust earthquakes. Parts of the city are also vulnerable to tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960.\\n\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\n\\nLos Angeles has a Subtropical-Mediterranean climate (K\\xf6ppen climate classification Csb on the coast, Csa inland), and receives just enough annual precipitation to avoid either K\\xf6ppen\\'s BSh or BSk (semi-arid climate) classification. Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.\\nTemperatures exceed 90 \\xb0F (32 \\xb0C) on a dozen or so days in the year, from one day a month in April, May, June and November to three days a month in July, August, October and to five days in September. Temperatures are subject to substantial daily swings; in inland areas the difference between the average daily low and the average daily high is over 30 Fahrenheit (16 Celsius) degrees. The average annual temperature of the sea is 63 \\xb0F (17 \\xb0C), from 58 \\xb0F (14 \\xb0C) in January to 68 \\xb0F (20 \\xb0C) in August. Hours of sunshine total more than 3,000 per year, from an average of 7 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12 in July.\\nThe Los Angeles area is also subject to phenomena typical of a microclimate, causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other. For instance, the average July maximum temperature at the Santa Monica Pier is 75 \\xb0F (24 \\xb0C) whereas it is 95 \\xb0F (35 \\xb0C) in Canoga Park. The city, like much of the southern California coast, is subject to a late spring/early summer weather phenomenon called \"June Gloom.\" This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning which yield to sun by early afternoon. In the warm months, dewpoints range from 56.4 \\xb0F (13.6 \\xb0C) in June to 61.1 \\xb0F (16.2 \\xb0C) in August.\\nDowntown Los Angeles averages 15.14 inches (384.6 mm) of precipitation annually, which mainly occurs during the winter and spring (November through April), generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but often as heavy rainfall and thunderstorms during winter storms. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the mountains get slightly more. However the San Fernando Valley Region of Los Angeles can get between 16 and 20 inches (410 and 510 mm) of rain per year. Years of average rainfall are rare; the usual pattern is bimodal, with a short string of dry years (perhaps 7\\u20138 inches or 180\\u2013200 millimetres) followed by one or two wet years that make up the average. Snowfall is extremely rare in the city basin, but the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2 inches (5 cm) in 1932. The highest recorded temperature in downtown Los Angeles is 113 \\xb0F (45 \\xb0C) on September 27, 2010 and the lowest recorded temperature is 24 \\xb0F (\\u22124 \\xb0C) on December 22, 1944.\\n\\n\\n=== Environmental issues ===\\n\\nA Gabrielino settlement in the area was called iy\\xe1ang\\u1e9a (written Yang-na by the Spanish), which has been translated as \"poison oak place\". Yang-na has also been translated as \"the valley of smoke.\" Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog. The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources.\\nThe smog season lasts from May to October. While other large cities rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches (380 mm) of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act. More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low-emission vehicles. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years due to aggressive steps to reduce it, which include electric and hybrid cars, improvements in mass transit, and other measures.\\nThe number of Stage 1 smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium. Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution. In 2008, the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate pollution. The city met its goal of providing 20 percent of the city\\'s power from renewable sources in 2010. The American Lung Association\\'s 2013 survey ranks the metro area as having the nation\\'s worst smog, and fourth in both short term and year round pollution amounts.\\nClimate change has already affected Los Angeles with a 4 degree average temperature rise from 1878 to 2005 with a UCLA study predicting that coastal areas will rise 3 to 4 degrees in temperature and urban areas 4 to 4.5 degrees. In 2014, the fire season never finished in Southern California and studies have predicted that climate change will cause more frequent and larger fires by the end of the century. Climate change is also expected to affect sea levels which are expected to rise 5 to 24 inches from 2000 to 2050 leading to higher storm surge and waves, which could result in more extensive flooding that could threaten critical coastal infrastructure.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Los Angeles had a population of 3,792,621. The population density was 8,092.3 people per square mile (2,913.0/km\\xb2). The age distribution was 874,525 people (23.1%) under 18, 434,478 people (11.5%) from 18 to 24, 1,209,367 people (31.9%) from 25 to 44, 877,555 people (23.1%) from 45 to 64, and 396,696 people (10.5%) who were 65 or older. The median age was 34.1 years. For every 100 females there were 99.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.6 males.\\nThere were 1,413,995 housing units\\u2014up from 1,298,350 during 2005\\u20132009\\u2014at an average density of 2,812.8 households per square mile (1,086.0/km\\xb2), of which 503,863 (38.2%) were owner-occupied, and 814,305 (61.8%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 2.1%; the rental vacancy rate was 6.1%. 1,535,444 people (40.5% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 2,172,576 people (57.3%) lived in rental housing units.\\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, Los Angeles had a median household income of $49,745, with 21.2% of the population living below the federal poverty line.\\n\\n\\n=== Race and ethnicity ===\\nLos Angeles is home to people from more than 140 countries speaking 224 different identified languages. Ethnic enclaves like Chinatown, Historic Filipinotown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, Little Ethiopia, Tehrangeles, Little Tokyo, Little Bangladesh and Thai Town provide examples of the polyglot character of Los Angeles.\\nAccording to the 2010 Census, the racial makeup of Los Angeles included: 1,888,158 Whites (49.8%), 365,118 African Americans (9.6%), 28,215 Native Americans (0.7%), 426,959 Asians (11.3%), 5,577 Pacific Islanders (0.1%), 902,959 from other races (23.8%), and 175,635 (4.6%) from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 1,838,822 persons (48.5%).\\nNon-Hispanic whites were 28.7% of the population in 2010, compared to 86.3% in 1940. Mexicans make up the largest ethnic group of Latinos at 31.9% of Los Angeles\\' population, followed by Salvadorans (6.0%) and Guatemalans (3.6%). The Latino population is spread throughout the city of Los Angeles and its metropolitan area but it is most heavily concentrated in the East Los Angeles region, which has a long established Mexican American and Central American community.\\nThe largest Asian ethnic groups are Filipinos (3.2%) and Koreans (2.9%), which have their own established ethnic enclaves\\u2212Koreatown in the Wilshire Center and Historic Filipinotown. Chinese people, which make up 1.8% of Los Angeles\\' population, reside mostly outside of Los Angeles city limits and rather in the San Gabriel Valley of eastern Los Angeles County, but make a sizable presence in the city, notably in Chinatown. Chinatown and Thaitown are also home to many Thais and Cambodians, which make up 0.3% and 0.1% of Los Angeles\\' population, respectively. Japanese comprise 0.9% of L.A.\\'s population, and have an established Little Tokyo in the city\\'s downtown, and another significant community of Japanese Americans is located in the Sawtelle district of West Los Angeles.

In 1970, the Census Bureau reported city\\'s population as 17.9% black, 61.1% non-Hispanic white and 17.1% Hispanic. However, since the 1980s, there has been a large influx of immigration from Mexico and Central America which have outnumbered the blacks in South Los Angeles. South Los Angeles, as well as neighboring communities such as the city of Compton that were home to predominant African American populations are now transforming into Hispanic communities.\\nPacific Islanders make up 0.1% of Los Angeles\\' population, and are concentrated in southwestern Los Angeles County, namely in Long Beach and Carson, which are home to thousands of Samoan Americans.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\n\\nThe Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles leads the largest archdiocese in the country. Cardinal Roger Mahony oversaw construction of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which opened in September 2002 in downtown Los Angeles. Construction of the cathedral marked a coming of age of the city\\'s Catholic, heavily Latino community. There are numerous Catholic churches and parishes throughout Los Angeles.\\nIn 2011 the once common but ultimately lapsed custom of conducting a procession and Mass in honour of Nuestra Se\\xf1ora de los \\xc1ngeles in commemoration of the founding of the City of Los Angeles in 1781 was revived by the Queen of Angels Foundation and its founder Mark Albert, with the support and approbation of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles as well as several civic leaders. The recently revived custom is a continuation of the original processions and Masses which commenced on the first anniversary of the founding of Los Angeles in 1782 and continued for nearly a century thereafter.\\nWith 621,000 Jews in the metropolitan area (490,000 in city proper), the region has the second largest population of Jews in the United States. Many of Los Angeles\\' Jews now live on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley, though Boyle Heights and Northwest Los Angeles once had large Jewish populations. Many varieties of Judaism are represented in the area, including Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and Reconstructionist. The Breed Street Shul in East Los Angeles, built in 1923, was the largest synagogue west of Chicago in its early decades. (It is no longer a sacred space and is being converted to a museum and community center.) The Kabbalah Centre also has a presence in the city.\\nThe International Church of the Foursquare Gospel was founded in Los Angeles by Aimee Semple McPherson in 1927 and remains headquartered there to this day. For many years, the church convened at Angelus Temple, which, when built, was one of the largest churches in the country.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles California Temple, the second largest temple operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is on Santa Monica Boulevard in the Westwood district of Los Angeles. Dedicated in 1956, it was the first LDS temple built in California and it was the largest in the world when completed.\\nThe Hollywood region of Los Angeles also has several significant headquarters, churches, and the Celebrity Center of Scientology.\\nBecause of Los Angeles\\' large multi-ethnic population, a wide variety of faiths are practiced, including Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, Bah\\xe1\\'\\xed, various Eastern Orthodox Churches, Sufism and others. Immigrants from Asia for example, have formed a number of significant Buddhist congregations making the city home to the greatest variety of Buddhists in the world.\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\n\\nThe economy of Los Angeles is driven by international trade, entertainment (television, motion pictures, video games, recorded music), aerospace, technology, petroleum, fashion, apparel, and tourism. Los Angeles is also the largest manufacturing center in the western United States. The contiguous ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach together comprise the fifth-busiest port in the world and the most significant port in the Western Hemisphere and is vital to trade within the Pacific Rim. Other significant industries include media production, finance, telecommunications, law, healthcare, and transportation.\\nLos Angeles is commonly associated with the entertainment industry; three of the six major film studios\\u2014Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and Universal Pictures\\u2014are located within the city limits with the remaining three located in surrounding cities. Beyond motion picture and television program production, other major industries of Los Angeles are international trade supported by the Port of Los Angeles, music recording and production, aerospace, and professional services such as law and medicine.\\nThe Los Angeles\\u2013Long Beach\\u2013Santa Ana metropolitan statistical area (MSA) has a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $735.7 billion (as of 2010), making it the third largest economic center in the world, after the Greater Tokyo Area and the New York-Newark-Bridgeport CSA. If counted as a country, the surrounding CSA has the 15th largest economy in the world in terms of nominal GDP. Los Angeles has been classified an \"Alpha world city\" according to a 2012 study by a research group at Loughborough University in England.\\nThe city is home to six Fortune 500 companies. They are energy company Occidental Petroleum, healthcare provider Health Net, metals distributor Reliance Steel & Aluminum, engineering firm AECOM, real estate group CBRE Group and builder Tutor Perini.

At one time Los Angeles area had two NFL teams, the Rams and the Raiders. Both left the city in 1995, with the Rams moving to St. Louis, and the Raiders heading back to their original home of Oakland. Prior to 1995, the Rams called Memorial Coliseum home (1946\\u20131979) and the Raiders played their home games at Memorial Coliseum from 1982 to 1994.\\n\\nSince the franchises\\' departures, the NFL and individual NFL owners have attempted to relocate a team to the city. Following the 1995 NFL season, the Seattle Seahawks planned to play in the Rose Bowl under a new team name and logo for the 1996 season, but the State of Washington filed a lawsuit to prevent the move. Despite the failure to build a new stadium for an NFL team, Los Angeles is still expected to return to the league through expansion or relocation. On August 9, 2011, the LA City Council approved plans to build Farmers Field, which may become home to an NFL team in the future.\\nLos Angeles has twice played host to the Summer Olympic Games, in 1932 and in 1984. When the tenth Olympic Games were hosted in 1932, the former 10th Street was renamed Olympic Blvd. Super Bowls I and VII were also held in the city as well as multiple FIFA World Cup games in 1994 including the final.

The neighborhood councils are relatively autonomous and spontaneous in that they identify their own boundaries, establish their own bylaws, and elect their own officers. There are currently about 90 neighborhood councils.\\nResidents of Los Angeles elect supervisors for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th supervisorial districts.\\n\\n\\n=== Federal and state representation ===\\nIn the California State Assembly, Los Angeles is split between fourteen districts. In the California State Senate, the city is split between eight districts. In the United States House of Representatives, it is split between ten congressional districts.\\n\\n\\n=== Crime ===\\n\\nLike most American cities, Los Angeles has been experiencing significant decline in crime since the mid-1990s, and reached a 50-year low in 2009 with 314 homicides. This is a rate of 7.85 per 100,000 population\\u2014a major decrease from 1993, when the all-time high homicide rate of over 21.1 per 100,000 was reported for the year. This included 15 officer-involved shootings. One shooting led to the death of a SWAT team member, Randal Simmons, the first in LAPD\\'s history. Los Angeles in the year of 2013 totaled 251 murders, a decrease of 16 percent from the previous year. Police speculate that the drop resulted from a number of factors, including young people spending more time online.\\nThe Dragna crime family and the Cohen crime family dominated organized crime in the city during the Prohibition era and reached its peak during the 1940s and 1950s as part of the American Mafia but has gradually declined since then with the rise of various black and Hispanic gangs.\\nAccording to the Los Angeles Police Department, the city is home to 45,000 gang members, organized into 450 gangs. Among them are the Crips and Bloods, which are both African American street gangs that originated in South Los Angeles. Latino street gangs such as the Sure\\xf1os, a Mexican American street gang, and Mara Salvatrucha, which has mainly members of Salvadoran descent, all originated in Los Angeles. The 18th Street has a predominately Latino membership but is multiethnic. This has led to the city being referred to as the \"Gang Capital of America\".\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\n\\n\\n=== Colleges and universities ===\\n\\nThere are three public universities located within the city limits: California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), California State University, Northridge (CSUN) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\\nPrivate colleges in the city include the American Film Institute Conservatory, Alliant International University, Syracuse University (Los Angeles Campus), American Jewish University, The American Musical and Dramatic Academy \\u2013 Los Angeles campus, Antioch University\\'s Los Angeles campus, Biola University, Charles R.

The Claremont Colleges consortium, which includes some of the most prestigious liberal arts colleges in the United States, is located 35 miles (56 km) east of downtown Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n=== Schools and libraries ===\\n\\nLos Angeles Unified School District serves almost all of the city of Los Angeles, as well as several surrounding communities, with a student population around 800,000. After Proposition 13 was approved in 1978, urban school districts had considerable trouble with funding. LAUSD has become known for its underfunded, overcrowded and poorly maintained campuses, although its 162 Magnet schools help compete with local private schools. Several small sections of Los Angeles are in the Las Virgenes Unified School District. The Los Angeles County Office of Education operates the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. The Los Angeles Public Library system operates 72 public libraries in the city. Enclaves of unincorporated areas are served by branches of the County of Los Angeles Public Library, many of which are within walking distance to residents.\\n\\n\\n== Media ==\\n\\nThe major daily English-language newspaper in the area is the Los Angeles Times. La Opini\\xf3n is the city\\'s major daily Spanish-language paper, The Korea Times is the city\\'s major daily Korean language paper, and the Los Angeles Sentinel is the city\\'s major African-American weekly paper, boasting the largest Black readership in the Western United States.

Record (which focuses coverage on the music scene in the Greater Los Angeles Area), Los Angeles magazine, Los Angeles Business Journal, Los Angeles Daily Journal (legal industry paper), The Hollywood Reporter and Variety (entertainment industry papers), and Los Angeles Downtown News. In addition to the major papers, numerous local periodicals serve immigrant communities in their native languages, including Armenian, English, Korean, Persian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, and Arabic. Many cities adjacent to Los Angeles also have their own daily newspapers whose coverage and availability overlaps into certain Los Angeles neighborhoods. Examples include The Daily Breeze (serving the South Bay), and The Long Beach Press-Telegram.\\nLos Angeles and New York City are the only two media markets to have seven VHF allocations assigned to them.\\nThe city has major broadcast channels as well as three PBS stations. World TV operates on two channels and the area has several Spanish-language television networks. KTBN 40 is the flagship station of the religious Trinity Broadcasting Network, based out of Santa Ana. A variety of independent television stations also operate in the area.\\n\\n\\n== Transportation ==\\n\\n\\n=== Freeways ===\\n\\nThe city and the rest of the Los Angeles metropolitan area are served by an extensive network of freeways and highways. The Texas Transportation Institute, which publishes an annual Urban Mobility Report, ranked Los Angeles road traffic as the most congested in the United States in 2005 as measured by annual delay per traveler. The average traveler in Los Angeles experienced 72 hours of traffic delay per year according to the study. Los Angeles was followed by San Francisco/Oakland, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, (each with 60 hours of delay). Despite the congestion in the city, the mean travel time for commuters in Los Angeles is shorter than other major cities, including New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. Los Angeles\\' mean travel time for work commutes in 2006 was 29.2 minutes, similar to those of San Francisco and Washington, D.C.\\nAmong the major highways that connect LA to the rest of the nation include Interstate 5, which runs south through San Diego to Tijuana in Mexico and north through Sacramento, Portland, and Seattle to the Canadian border; Interstate 10, the southernmost east\\u2013west, coast-to-coast Interstate Highway in the United States, going to Jacksonville, Florida; and U.S. Route 101, which heads to the California Central Coast, San Francisco, the Redwood Empire, and the Oregon and Washington coasts.\\n\\n\\n=== Transit systems ===\\n\\nThe LA County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and other agencies operate an extensive system of bus lines, as well as subway and light rail lines across Los Angeles County, with a combined monthly ridership (measured in individual boardings) of 38.8 million as of September 2011. The majority of this (30.5 million) is taken up by the city\\'s bus system, the second busiest in the country. The subway and light rail combined average the remaining roughly 8.2 million boardings per month. In 2005, 10.2% of Los Angeles commuters rode some form of public transportation.\\nThe city\\'s subway system is the ninth busiest in the United States and its light rail system is the country\\'s second busiest. The rail system includes the Red and Purple subway lines, as well as the Gold, Blue, Expo, and Green light rail lines. The Metro Orange and Silver lines are bus rapid transit lines with stops and frequency similar to those of light rail. The city is also central to the commuter rail system Metrolink, which links Los Angeles to all neighboring counties as well as many suburbs.\\nBesides the rail service provided by Metrolink and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Los Angeles is served by inter-city passenger trains from Amtrak. The main rail station in the city is Union Station just north of Downtown.\\n\\n\\n=== Airports ===\\n\\nThe main international and domestic airport serving Los Angeles is Los Angeles International Airport (IATA: LAX, ICAO: KLAX), commonly referred to by its airport code, LAX. The sixth busiest commercial airport in the world and the third busiest in the United States, LAX handled over 66 million passengers and close to 2 million tons of cargo in 2013.\\nOther major nearby commercial airports include:\\n(IATA: ONT, ICAO: KONT) LA/Ontario International Airport, owned by the city of Los Angeles; serves the Inland Empire.\\n(IATA: BUR, ICAO: KBUR) Bob Hope Airport, formerly known as Burbank Airport; serves the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys\\n(IATA: LGB, ICAO: KLGB) Long Beach Airport, serves the Long Beach/Harbor area\\n(IATA: SNA, ICAO: KSNA) John Wayne Airport of Orange County\\nOne of the world\\'s busiest general-aviation airports is also located in Los Angeles, Van Nuys Airport (IATA: VNY, ICAO: KVNY).\\n\\n\\n=== Seaports ===\\n\\nThe Port of Los Angeles is located in San Pedro Bay in the San Pedro neighborhood, approximately 20 miles (32 km) south of Downtown. Also called Los Angeles Harbor and WORLDPORT LA, the port complex occupies 7,500 acres (30 km2) of land and water along 43 miles (69 km) of waterfront. It adjoins the separate Port of Long Beach.\\nThe sea ports of the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach together make up the Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbor. Together, both ports are the fifth busiest container port in the world, with a trade volume of over 14.2 million TEU\\'s in 2008. Singly, the Port of Los Angeles is the busiest container port in the United States and the largest cruise ship center on the West Coast of the United States \\u2013 The Port of Los Angeles\\' World Cruise Center served about 590,000 passengers in 2014.\\nThere are also smaller, non-industrial harbors along Los Angeles\\' coastline. The port includes four bridges: the Vincent Thomas Bridge, Henry Ford Bridge, Gerald Desmond Bridge, and Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge. Passenger ferry service from San Pedro to the city of Avalon on Santa Catalina Island is provided by Catalina Express.\\n\\n\\n== Notable people ==\\n\\nAs home to Hollywood and its entertainment industry, numerous singers, actors and other entertainers live in various districts of Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n== Twin towns \\u2013 Sister cities ==\\n\\nLos Angeles has 25 sister cities, listed chronologically by year joined:\\n\\nIn addition, Los Angeles has the following \"friendship cities\":\\n London, England, United Kingdom\\n \\u0141\\xf3d\\u017a, Poland\\n Manchester, England, United Kingdom\\n Los Angeles also has an exchange partnership with Tel Aviv, Israel.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\nGeneral\\nCarey McWilliams (2009).

Built to create a navigable water route from New York City and the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes, the canal helped New York eclipse Philadelphia as the largest city and port on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. The canal is now part of the New York State Canal System.\\nFirst proposed in 1807, its construction began in 1817. The canal contains 36 locks and a total elevation differential of about 565 feet (172 m). It opened on October 26, 1825.\\nIn a time when bulk goods were limited to pack animals (an eighth-ton [250 pounds (113 kg)] maximum), and there were no steamships or railways, water was the most cost-effective way to ship bulk goods. The canal was the first transportation system between the eastern seaboard (New York City) and the western interior (Great Lakes) of the United States that did not require portage. It was faster than carts pulled by draft animals, and cut transport costs by about 95%. The canal fostered a population surge in western New York, opened regions farther west to settlement, and helped New York City become the chief U.S. port. It was enlarged between 1834 and 1862. In 1918, the western part of the canal was enlarged to become part of the Bob Wells Canal, which ran parallel to the eastern half and extended to the Hudson.\\nToday, the Erie Canal is the cross-state east-west route of the New York State Canal System (formerly known as the New York State Barge Canal). In 2000, the United States Congress designated the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor to recognize the national significance of the canal system as the most successful and influential human-built waterway and one of the most important works of civil engineering and construction in North America. Mainly used by recreational watercraft since the last large commercial ship (rather than boat), the Day Peckinpaugh in 1994, the canal has recently seen a recovery in commercial traffic.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\nFrom the first days of the expansion of the British colonies from the coast of North America into the heartland of the continent, a recurring problem was that of transportation between the coastal ports and the interior. Close to the seacoast, rivers often provided adequate waterways, but the presence of the Appalachian Mountains, 400 miles (640 km) inland, presented a great challenge. Passengers and freight had to travel overland, a journey made more difficult by the rough condition of the roads. In 1800, it typically took 2.5 weeks to travel overland from New York to Cleveland, Ohio [460 miles (740 km)]; 4 weeks to Detroit [612 miles (985 km)].\\nThat the principal exportable product of the Ohio Valley was grain did not help matters, as grain was a high-volume, low-priced commodity bolstered by supplies from the coast, frequently not worth the cost of transporting it to far-away population centers (this was a factor leading to farmers in the west turning their grains into whiskey for easier transport and higher sales, and later the Whiskey Rebellion). In the 18th and early 19th centuries, it became clear to coastal residents that the city or state that succeeded in developing a cheap, reliable route to the West would enjoy economic success, and that the port at the seaward end of such a route would see business increase greatly. In time, projects were devised in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and relatively deep into coastal states.\\n\\n\\n== Proposals and logistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Proposals ===\\n\\nEarly proposals\\nThe successes of the Canal du Midi in France (1681), Bridgewater Canal in Britain (fully completed 1769) and Eiderkanal (superseded by today\\'s Kiel Canal) in Denmark (later Germany) (1784) spurred on what was called in Britain \\'canal mania\\'. Already the idea of a canal (realistically, instead, that of a tamed river for most of its length) to tie the East Coast to the new western settlements was in the air in 1724: New York provincial official Cadwallader Colden made a passing reference (in a report on fur trading) to improving the natural waterways of western New York.\\nTwo men, Gouverneur Morris and Elkanah Watson, were other early proponents of a canal along the Mohawk. Their efforts led to the creation of the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company (which took the first steps to improve navigation on the Mohawk), but the company proved that private financing was insufficient. In 1798 the Niagara Canal Company was incorporated - see Welland Canal.\\nPotomac/Patowmack precedent\\nGeorge Washington led a partly enduring effort to turn the Potomac River into a navigable link to the west, sinking substantial energy and capital into the Patowmack Canal from 1785 until his death fourteen years later.\\nBy 1788 Washington\\'s Potomac Company was successful in constructing five locks which took boats 4,500 feet (1,400 m) past the Potomac Great Falls. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal superseded the Potomac Canal in 1823.\\nChristopher Colles (who was familiar with the Bridgewater Canal) surveyed the Mohawk Valley, and made a presentation to the New York state legislature in 1784 proposing a canal from Lake Ontario. The proposal drew attention and some action, but came to naught (in actual construction).\\nScheme\\nJesse Hawley finally got the canal built. He had envisioned encouraging the growing of large quantities of grain on the Western New York plains (then largely unsettled) for sale on the Eastern seaboard. However, he went bankrupt trying to ship grain to the coast. While in Canandaigua debtors\\' prison, Hawley began pressing for the construction of a canal along the 90-mile (140 km)-long Mohawk River valley with support from Joseph Ellicott (agent for the Holland Land Company in Batavia). Ellicott realized that a canal would add value to the land he was selling in the western part of the state. He later became the first canal commissioner.\\n\\n\\n=== Engineering Requirements ===\\nThe Mohawk River (a tributary of the Hudson) rises near Lake Ontario and runs in a glacial meltwater channel just north of the Catskill range of the Appalachian Mountains, separating them from the geologically distinct Adirondacks to the north. The Mohawk and Hudson valleys form the only cut across the Appalachians north of Alabama, allowing an almost complete water route from New York City in the south to Lakes Ontario and Erie in the west. Along its course and from these lakes, other Great Lakes, and to a lesser degree, related rivers, a large part of the continent\\'s interior (and many settlements) would be made well connected to the Eastern seaboard.\\nThe problem was that the land rises about 600 feet (180 m) from the Hudson to Lake Erie. Locks at the time could handle up to 12 feet (3.7 m), so even with the heftiest cuttings and viaducts, fifty locks would be required along the 360-mile (580 km) canal. Such a canal would be expensive to build even with modern technology; in 1800, the expense was barely imaginable. President Thomas Jefferson called it \"a little short of madness\" and rejected it; however, Hawley interested New York Governor DeWitt Clinton in the project. There was much opposition, and the project was ridiculed as \"Clinton\\'s folly\" and \"Clinton\\'s ditch.\" In 1817, though, Clinton received approval from the legislature for $7 million for construction.\\nThe original canal was 363 miles (584 km) long, from Albany on the Hudson to Buffalo on Lake Erie. The channel was cut 40 feet (12 m) wide and 4 feet (1.2 m) deep, with removed soil piled on the downhill side to form a walkway known as a towpath.\\nIts construction, through limestone and mountains, proved a daunting task. Mosquito-borne malaria killed over 1,000 during a single season. The canal was built using some of the most advanced engineering technology from Holland. In 1823 construction reached the Niagara Escarpment, necessitating the building of five locks along a 3-mile (4.8 km) corridor to carry the canal over the escarpment. To move earth, animals pulled a \"slip scraper\" (similar to a bulldozer). The sides of the canal were lined with stone set in clay, and the bottom was also lined with clay. The stonework required hundreds of German masons, who later built many of New York\\'s buildings. All labor on the canal depended upon human (and animal) power or the force of water. Engineering techniques developed during its construction included the building of aqueducts to redirect water; one aqueduct was 950 feet (290 m) long to span 800 feet (240 m) of river. As the canal progressed, the crews and engineers working on the project developed expertise and became a skilled labor force.\\n\\n\\n=== Operation ===\\nCanal boats up to 3.5 feet (1.1 m) in draft were pulled by horses and mules on the towpath. This canal has one towpath generally on the north side. When canal boats met, the boat with the right of way remained on the towpath side of the canal. The other boat steered toward the berm (or heelpath) side of the canal. The driver (or \"hoggee\", pronounced HO-gee) of the privileged boat kept his towpath team by the canalside edge of the towpath, while the hoggee of the other boat moved to the outside of the towpath and stopped his team. His towline would be unravelled from the horses, go slack, fall into the water and sink to the bottom while his boat decelerated on with its remaining momentum. The privileged boat\\'s team would step over the other boat\\'s towline with their horses pulling the boat over the sunken towline without stopping. Once clear, the other boat\\'s team would continue on its way.\\n\\n\\n== Construction ==\\n\\nConstruction began July 4, 1817, at Rome, New York. The first 15 miles (24 km), from Rome to Utica, opened in 1819. At that rate the canal would not be finished for thirty years. The main hold-ups were felling trees to clear a path through virgin forest and moving excavated soil, which took longer than expected, but the builders solved these problems. To fell a tree, they threw rope over the top branches and winched it down. They pulled out the stumps with an innovative stump puller. A pair of huge wheels were mounted loose on an axle. A large wheel, barely smaller than the others, was fixed to the center of the axle. A chain was wrapped around the axle and hooked to the stump. A rope was wrapped around the center wheel and hooked to a team of oxen. The mechanical advantage (torque) obtained ripped the stumps out of the soil. Soil to be moved was shoveled into large wheelbarrows that were dumped into mule-pulled carts.\\nUsing a scraper and a plow, a three-man team with oxen, horses, and mules could build a mile in a year. The remaining problem was finding enough labor, and increased immigration helped fill the need. The men who planned and oversaw construction were novices, both as surveyors and as engineers. There were no civil engineers in the United States. James Geddes and Benjamin Wright, who laid out the route, were judges whose experience in surveying was in settling boundary disputes. Geddes had only used a surveying instrument for a few hours before his work on the Canal. Canvass White was a 27-year-old amateur engineer who persuaded Clinton to let him go to Britain at his own expense to study the canal system there. Nathan Roberts was a mathematics teacher and land speculator. Yet these men \"carried the Erie Canal up the Niagara escarpment at Lockport, maneuvered it onto a towering embankment to cross over Irondequoit Creek, spanned the Genesee River on an awesome aqueduct, and carved a route for it out of the solid rock between Little Falls and Schenectady\\u2014and all of those venturesome designs worked precisely as planned\". (Bernstein, p. 381) Many of the laborers working on the canal were Scots Irish, who had recently come to the United States as a group of about 5,000 from Northern Ireland, most of whom were Protestants and wealthy enough to pay for this caravan.\\n\\nConstruction continued at an increased rate as new workers arrived. When the canal reached Montezuma Marsh (at the outlet of Cayuga Lake west of Syracuse), it was rumored that over 1,000 workers died of \"swamp fever\" (malaria) and construction stopped. However, recent research has revealed that the death toll was likely much lower, as no contemporary reports mention significant worker mortality, and mass graves from the period have never been found in the area. Work continued on the downhill side towards the Hudson, and when the marsh froze in winter, the crews worked to complete the section across the swamps.\\nThe middle section from Utica to Salina (Syracuse) was completed in 1820 and traffic on that section started up immediately. Expansion to the east and west proceeded, and the whole eastern section, 250 miles (400 km) from Brockport to Albany, opened on September 10, 1823 to great fanfare.\\nThe Champlain Canal, a 64 miles (103 km) north-south route from Watervliet on the Hudson to Lake Champlain, opened on the same date.\\nIn 1824, before the canal was completed, a detailed Pocket Guide for the Tourist and Traveler, Along the Line of the Canals, and the Interior Commerce of the State of New York, was published for the benefit of travelers and land speculators\\u2014possibly America\\'s first tour guide.\\nAfter Montezuma Marsh, the next obstacle was crossing the Niagara Escarpment, an 80-foot (24 m) wall of hard dolomitic limestone, to rise to the level of Lake Erie. The route followed the channel of a creek that had cut a ravine steeply down the escarpment, with two sets of five locks in a series, giving rise to the community of Lockport. These 12-foot (3.7 m) lift-locks had a total lift of 60 feet (18 m), exiting into a deeply cut channel. The final leg had to be cut 30 feet (9.1 m) through another limestone layer, the Onondaga ridge. Much of that section was blasted with black powder. The inexperience of the crews often led to accidents, and sometimes rocks falling on nearby homes.\\nTwo villages competed to be the terminus: Black Rock, on the Niagara River, and Buffalo, at the eastern tip of Lake Erie. Buffalo expended great energy to widen and deepen Buffalo Creek to make it navigable and to create a harbor at its mouth. Buffalo won over Black Rock, and grew into a large city, encompassing its former competitor.\\nWork was completed on October 26, 1825. The event was marked by a statewide \"Grand Celebration,\" culminating in successive cannon shots along the length of the canal and the Hudson, a 90-minute cannonade from Buffalo to New York City. A flotilla of boats, led by Governor Dewitt Clinton aboard the Seneca Chief, sailed from Buffalo to New York City in ten days. Clinton then ceremonially poured Lake Erie water into New York Harbor to mark the \"Wedding of the Waters.\" On its return trip, the Seneca Chief brought a keg of Atlantic Ocean water back to Buffalo to be poured into Lake Erie by Buffalo\\'s Judge Samuel Wilkeson, who would later become mayor.\\nThe Erie Canal was thus completed in eight years at a cost of $7 million; it was acclaimed as an engineering marvel that united the country and helped New York City to become a financial capital.\\n\\n\\n== Route ==\\n\\nThe canal began on the west side of the Hudson River at Albany, and ran north to Watervliet, where the Champlain Canal branched off. At Cohoes, it climbed the escarpment on the west side of the Hudson River and then turned west along the south shore of the Mohawk River, crossing to the north side at Crescent and again to the south at Rexford. The canal continued west near the south shore of the Mohawk River all the way to Rome, where the Mohawk turns north.\\nAt Rome, the canal continued west parallel to Wood Creek, which flows westward into Oneida Lake, and turned southwest and west cross-country to avoid the lake. From Canastota west, it ran roughly along the north (lower) edge of the Onondaga Escarpment, passing through Syracuse and Rochester. Before reaching Rochester, the canal uses a series of natural ridges to cross the deep valley of Irondequoit Creek (a preglacial course of the Genesee River). At Lockport the canal turned southwest to rise to the top of the Niagara Escarpment, using the ravine of Eighteen Mile Creek.\\nThe canal continued south-southwest to Pendleton, where it turned west and southwest, mainly using the channel of Tonawanda Creek. From Tonawanda south toward Buffalo, it ran just east of the Niagara River, where it reached its \"Western Terminus\" at Little Buffalo Creek (later it became the Commercial Slip), which discharged into the Buffalo River just above its confluence with Lake Erie. With Buffalo\\'s re-excavation of Commercial Slip, completed in 2008, the Canal\\'s original terminus is now re-watered and again accessible by boats. With several miles of the Canal inland of this location still lying under 20th-century fill and urban construction, the effective western navigable terminus of the Erie Canal is found at Tonawanda.\\nThe Erie made use of the favorable conditions of New York\\'s unique topography providing that area with the only break in the Appalachians south of the Saint Lawrence River. The Hudson is tidal to Troy, and Albany is west of the Appalachians. It allowed for east-west navigation from the coast to the Great Lakes within US territory. The canal system thus gave New York a competitive advantage, helped New York City develop as an international trade center, and allowed Buffalo to grow from just 200 settlers in 1820 to more than 18,000 people by 1840. The port of New York became essentially the Atlantic home port for all of the Midwest \\u2013 because of this vital connection and others to follow, such as the railroads, New York would become known as the \"Empire State\" or \"the great Empire State\".\\n\\n\\n== Enlargements and improvements ==\\n\\nProblems developed but were quickly solved. Leaks developed along the entire length of the canal, but these were sealed using cement that hardened underwater (hydraulic cement). Erosion on the clay bottom proved to be a problem and the speed was limited to 4 mph (6 km/h).\\nThe original design planned for an annual tonnage of 1.5 million tons (1.36 million metric tons), but this was exceeded immediately. An ambitious program to improve the canal began in 1834. During this massive series of construction projects, known as the First Enlargement, the canal was widened to 70 feet (21 m) and deepened to 7 feet (2.1 m). Locks were widened and/or rebuilt in new locations, and many new navigable aqueducts were constructed. The canal was straightened and slightly re-routed in some stretches, resulting in the abandonment of short segments of the original 1825 canal. The First Enlargement was completed in 1862, with further minor enlargements in later decades.\\nToday, the reconfiguration of the canal created during the First Enlargement is commonly referred to as the Improved Erie Canal or the Old Erie Canal, to distinguish it from the canal\\'s modern-day course. Existing remains of the 1825 canal abandoned during the Enlargement are sometimes referred to today as Clinton\\'s Ditch (which was also the popular nickname for the entire Erie Canal project during its original 1817\\u20131825 construction).\\n\\nAdditional feeder canals soon extended the Erie Canal into a system. These included the Cayuga-Seneca Canal south to the Finger Lakes, the Oswego Canal from Three Rivers north to Lake Ontario at Oswego, and the Champlain Canal from Troy north to Lake Champlain. From 1833 to 1877, the short Crooked Lake Canal connected Keuka Lake and Seneca Lake. The Chemung Canal connected the south end of Seneca Lake to Elmira in 1833, and was an important route for Pennsylvania coal and timber into the canal system. The Chenango Canal in 1836 connected the Erie Canal at Utica to Binghamton and caused a business boom in the Chenango River valley. The Chenango and Chemung canals linked the Erie with the Susquehanna River system. The Black River Canal connected the Black River to the Erie Canal at Rome and remained in operation until the 1920s. The Genesee Valley Canal was run along the Genesee River to connect with the Allegheny River at Olean, but the Allegheny section, which would have connected to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, was never built. The Genesee Valley Canal was later abandoned and became the route of the Genesee Valley Canal Railroad.\\nIn 1903 the New York State legislature authorized construction of the New York State Barge Canal as the \"Improvement of the Erie, the Oswego, the Champlain, and the Cayuga and Seneca Canals\". In 1905, construction of the Barge Canal began, which was completed in 1918, at a cost of $96.7 million. Freight traffic reached a total of 5.2 million short tons (4.7 million metric tons) by 1951, before declining in the face of combined rail and truck competition.\\n\\n\\n== Competition ==\\n\\nAs the canal brought travelers to New York City, it took business away from other ports such as Philadelphia and Baltimore. Those cities and their states started projects to compete with the Erie Canal. In Pennsylvania, the Main Line of Public Works was a combined canal and railroad running west from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh on the Ohio River, opened in 1834. In Maryland, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ran west to Wheeling, West Virginia, also on the Ohio River, and was completed in 1853.\\nOther competition was more direct. The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad opened in 1837, providing a bypass to the slowest part of the canal between Albany and Schenectady. Other railroads were soon chartered and built to continue the line west to Buffalo, and in 1842 a continuous line (which later became the New York Central Railroad and its Auburn Road in 1853) was open the whole way to Buffalo. As the railroad served the same general route as the canal, but provided for faster travel, passengers soon switched to it. However as late as 1852, the canal carried thirteen times more freight tonnage than all the railroads in New York State combined; it continued to compete well with the railroads through 1902, when tolls were abolished.\\nThe New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway was completed in 1884, as a route running closely parallel to both the canal and the New York Central Railroad. However, it went bankrupt and was acquired the next year by the New York Central.\\n\\n\\n== Impact ==\\n\\nThe Erie Canal greatly lowered the cost of shipping between the Midwest and the Northeast, bringing much lower food costs to Eastern cities and allowing the East to economically ship machinery and manufactured goods to the Mid-west. The canal also made an immense contribution to the wealth and importance of New York City, Buffalo, and New York State. Its impact went much further, increasing trade throughout the nation by opening eastern and overseas markets to Midwestern farm products and by enabling migration to the West.\\nNew ethnic Irish communities formed in some towns along its route after completion, as Irish immigrants were a large portion of the construction labor force. Earth extracted from the canal was transported to the New York city area and used as landfill in New York and New Jersey. A plaque honoring the canal\\'s construction is located in Battery Park in southern Manhattan.\\nBecause so many immigrants traveled on the canal, many genealogists have sought copies of canal passenger lists. Apart from the years 1827\\u20131829, canal boat operators were not required to record or report passenger names to the government, which, in this case, was the state of New York. Those 1827\\u20131829 passenger lists survive today in the New York State Archives, and other sources of traveler information are sometimes available.\\nThe Canal also helped bind the still-new nation closer to Britain and Europe. British repeal of the Corn Law resulted in a huge increase in exports of Midwestern wheat to Britain. Trade between the United States and Canada also increased as a result of the Corn Law and a reciprocity (free-trade) agreement signed in 1854; much of this trade flowed along the Erie.\\nIts success also prompted imitation: a rash of canal-building followed. Also, the many technical hurdles that had to be overcome made heroes of those whose innovations made the canal possible. This led to an increased public esteem for practical education. Chicago, among other Great Lakes cities, recognized the commercial importance of the canal to its economy, and two West Loop streets are named Canal and Clinton (for canal proponent DeWitt Clinton).\\nConcern that erosion caused by logging in the Adirondacks could silt up the canal contributed to the creation of another New York National Historic Landmark, the Adirondack Park, in 1885.\\n\\nMany notable authors wrote about the canal, including Herman Melville, Frances Trollope, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mark Twain, Samuel Hopkins Adams and the Marquis de Lafayette, and many tales and songs were written about life on the canal. The popular song \"Low Bridge\" by Thomas S. Allen was written in 1905 to memorialize the canal\\'s early heyday, when barges were pulled by mules rather than engines.\\n\\n\\n== 20th century ==\\n\\nIn 1918, the Canal was replaced by the larger New York State Barge Canal. This new canal replaced much of the original route, leaving many abandoned sections (most notably between Syracuse and Rome). New digging and flood control technologies allowed engineers to canalize rivers that the original canal had sought to avoid, such as the Mohawk, Seneca, and Clyde rivers, and Oneida Lake. In sections that did not consist of canalized rivers (particularly between Rochester and Buffalo), the original Erie Canal channel was enlarged to 120 feet (37 m) wide and 12 feet (3.7 m) deep. The expansion allowed barges up to 2,000 short tons (1,800 t) to use the Canal. This expensive project was politically unpopular in parts of the state not served by the canal, and failed to save it from becoming obsolete for commercial shipping.\\nThe new alignment began on the Hudson River at the border between Cohoes and Waterford, where it ran northwest with five locks (the so-called \"Waterford Flight\"), running into the Mohawk River east of Crescent. The Waterford Flight is claimed to be one of the steepest series of locks in the world.\\n\\nWhile the old Canal ran next to the Mohawk all the way to Rome, the new canal ran through the river, which was straightened or widened where necessary. At Ilion, the new canal left the river for good, but continued to run on a new alignment parallel to both the river and the old canal to Rome. From Rome, the new route continued almost due west, merging with Fish Creek just east of its entry into Oneida Lake.\\nFrom Oneida Lake, the new canal ran west along the Oneida River, with cutoffs to shorten the route. At Three Rivers the Oneida River turns northwest, and was deepened for the Oswego Canal to Lake Ontario. The new Erie Canal turned south there along the Seneca River, which turns west near Syracuse and continues west to a point in the Montezuma Marsh (43.00296\\xb0N 76.73115\\xb0W\\ufeff / 43.00296; -76.73115). There the Cayuga and Seneca Canal continued south with the Seneca River, and the new Erie Canal again ran parallel to the old Canal along the bottom of the Niagara Escarpment, in some places running along the Clyde River, and in some places replacing the old Canal. At Pittsford, southeast of Rochester, the Canal turned west to run around the south side of Rochester, rather than through downtown. The Canal currently crosses the Genesee River at the Genesee Valley Park (43.1215\\xb0N 77.6425\\xb0W\\ufeff / 43.1215; -77.6425), then rejoins the old path near North Gates.\\nFrom there it was again roughly an upgrade to the original canal, running west to Lockport. This reach of 64.2 miles from Henrietta to Lockport is called \"the 60\\u2011mile level\" since there are no locks and the water level rises only two feet over the entire segment. Diversions from and to adjacent natural streams along the way are used to maintain the canal\\'s level. It runs southwest to Tonawanda, where the new alignment discharges into the Niagara River, which is navigable upstream to the New York Barge Canal\\'s Black Rock Lock and thence to the Canal\\'s original \"Western Terminus\" at Buffalo\\'s Inner Harbor.\\nThe growth of railroads and highways across the state, and the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, caused commercial traffic on the canal to decline dramatically during the second half of the 20th century.\\n\\n\\n=== New York State Canal System ===\\nIn 1992, the New York State Barge Canal was renamed the New York State Canal System (including the Erie, Cayuga-Seneca, Oswego, and Champlain canals) and placed under the newly created New York State Canal Corporation, a subsidiary of the New York State Thruway Authority. The Canal System is operated using money generated by Thruway tolls.\\n\\n\\n== 21st century ==\\n\\nSince the 1990s, the Canal system has been used primarily by recreational traffic, although a small but growing amount of cargo traffic still uses it.\\nToday, the Erie Canal Corridor covers 524 miles (843 km) of navigable water from Lake Champlain to the Capital Region and west to Buffalo. The area has a population of 2.7 million: about 75% of Central and Western New York\\'s population lives within 25 miles (40 km) of the Erie Canal.\\nThe Erie Canal is open to small craft and some larger vessels from May through November each year. During winter, water is drained from parts of the canal for maintenance. The Champlain Canal, Lake Champlain, and the Chambly Canal, and Richelieu River in Canada form the Lakes to Locks Passage, making a tourist attraction of the former waterway linking eastern Canada to the Erie Canal. In 2006 recreational boating fees were eliminated to attract more visitors.\\nTravel on the Canal\\'s middle section (particularly in the Mohawk Valley) was severely hampered by flooding in late June and early July 2006. Flood damage to the canal and its facilities was estimated as at least $15 million.\\nThere were some 42 commercial shipments on the canal in 2008, compared to 15 such shipments in 2007 and more than 33,000 shipments in 1855, the canal\\'s peak year. The new growth in commercial traffic is due to the rising cost of diesel fuel. Canal barges can carry a short ton of cargo 514 miles (827 km) on one gallon of diesel fuel, while a gallon allows a train to haul the same amount of cargo 202 miles (325 km) and a truck 59 miles (95 km). Canal barges can carry loads up to 3,000 short tons (2,700 long tons), and are used to transport objects that would be too large for road or rail shipment. Today, the system is served by several commercial towing companies.\\n\\n\\n=== Old Erie Canal ===\\n\\nSections of the old Erie Canal not used after 1918 are owned by New York State, or have been ceded to or purchased by counties or municipalities. Many stretches of the old canal have been filled in to create roads such as Erie Boulevard in Syracuse and Schenectady, and Broad Street and the Rochester Subway in Rochester. A 36\\u2011mile (58 km) stretch of the old canal is preserved by New York State as Old Erie Canal State Historic Park. In 1960 the Schoharie Crossing State Historic Site, a section of the canal in Montgomery County, was one of the first sites recognized as a National Historic Landmark.\\nSome municipalities have preserved sections as town or county canal parks, or have plans to do so. Camillus Erie Canal Park preserves a 7-mile (11 km) stretch and has restored Nine Mile Creek Aqueduct, built in 1841 as part of the First Enlargement of the canal. In some communities, the old canal has refilled with overgrowth and debris. Proposals have been made to rehydrate the old canal through downtown Rochester or Syracuse as a tourist attraction. In Syracuse, the location of the old canal is represented by a reflecting pool in downtown\\'s Clinton Square and the downtown hosts a canal barge and weigh lock structure, now dry. Buffalo\\'s Commercial Slip is the recently restored and re-watered segment of the canal which formed its \"Western Terminus\".\\nThe Erie Canal is a destination for tourists from all over the world. An Erie Canal Cruise company, based in Herkimer, operates from mid-May until mid-October with daily cruises. The cruise goes through the history of the canal and also takes passengers through Lock 18.\\nIn 2004, the administration of New York Governor George Pataki was criticized when officials of New York State Canal Corporation attempted to sell private development rights to large stretches of the Old Erie Canal to a single developer for $30,000, far less than the land was worth on the open market. After an investigation by the Syracuse Post-Standard newspaper, the Pataki administration nullified the deal.\\n\\nRecords of the planning, design, construction, and administration of the Erie Canal are vast and can be found in the New York State Archives. Except for two years (1827\\u20131829), the state of New York did not require canal boat operators to maintain or submit passenger lists.\\n\\n\\n==== Parks and museums ====\\nParks and museums related to the old Erie Canal include (listed from East to West):\\nDay Peckinpaugh ship, currently under restoration and conversion to a floating museum, originally planned for completion in 2012\\nWatervliet Side Cut Locks, located at Watervliet and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971\\nEnlarged Erie Canal Historic District (Discontiguous), a national historic district located at Cohoes, New York listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004\\nEnlarged Double Lock No. 23, Old Erie Canal, Rotterdam\\nSchoharie Crossing State Historic Site at Fort Hunter\\nErie Canal Village, near Rome\\nCanastota Canal Town Museum Canastota\\nOld Erie Canal State Historic Park, 36-mile linear park, extending from the town of DeWitt, New York, to just outside of the city of Rome, New York\\nChittenango Landing Canal Boat Museum near Chittenango\\nErie Canal Museum in downtown Syracuse\\nCamillus Erie Canal Park in Camillus\\nJordan Canal Park in Jordan, town of Elbridge\\nEnlarged Double Lock No. 33 Old Erie Canal, St. Johnsville\\nErie Canal Lock 52 Complex, a national historic district located at Port Byron and Mentz in Cayuga County; listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998\\nSeneca River Crossing Canals Historic District, a national historic district located at Montezuma and Tyre in Cayuga County; listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005\\nCenterport Aqueduct Park near Weedsport; listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000\\nLock Berlin Park near Clyde\\nMacedon Aqueduct Park near Palmyra\\nOld Erie Canal Lock 60 Park in Macedon\\nPerinton Park in Perinton near Fairport\\nGenesee Valley Park near the city of Rochester\\nSpencerport Depot & Canal Museum, Spencerport\\nNiagara Escarpment \"Flight of Five\" locks at Lockport\\nErie Canal Discovery Center, 24 Church Street, Lockport (Locks 34 and 35)\\nBuffalo\\'s Commercial Slip at the Canal\\'s \"Western Terminus\"\\n\\n\\n==== Erie Canalway Trail ====\\n\\n\\n== Locks ==\\nThe following list of locks is provided for the current canal, from east to west:\\nNote: There is no Lock 1 or Lock 31 on the Erie Canal. The place of \"Lock 1\" on the passage from the lower Hudson to Lake Erie is taken by the Federal Lock, located just north of Troy, New York, and is not part of the Erie Canal System proper.\\n\\n*Note: The Black Rock Lock is in the New York State Barge Canal, and allows passage beside the Niagara River to the Erie Canal\\'s \"Western Terminus\" at the Commercial Slip. Upstream and downstream water levels, as well as Black Rock Lock\\'s lift, vary with the naturally fluctuating levels of Lake Erie and the Niagara River. Although a portion of the Erie Canal through Buffalo has been filled in, travel by water is still possible, from the Commercial Slip, through Buffalo\\'s Inner Harbor and the Black Rock Lock, to Tonawanda, New York, Lockport, and eastward to Albany.\\n*Note: The Waterford Flight series of locks (comprising Locks 2 through 6) is one of the steepest in the world.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nAlfred Barrett\\n\"Low Bridge\", song written by Thomas S.

At the invitation of the Onondaga Nation, one of the five constituent members of the Iroquois confederacy, a group of Jesuit priests, soldiers, and coureurs des bois (including Pierre Esprit Radisson) set up a mission, known as Saint Marie Among the Iroquois, or Ste. Marie de Gannent aha, on the northeast shore of Onondaga Lake.\\nThe mission was short lived, as the Mohawk Nation hinted to the Onondaga that they should sever their ties with the French, or the Onondaga\\'s guests would suffer a horrible fate. When the men in the mission caught wind of this, they left under cover of a cold night in March. Their stay had been less than two years. The remains of the mission have been located underneath a restaurant in nearby Liverpool. There is now a living history museum in Liverpool that recreates the mission.\\nJust after the Revolutionary War, more settlers came to the area, mostly to trade with the Onondaga Nation. Ephraim Webster left the Continental Army to settle in 1784, along with Asa Danforth, another Revolutionary War hero. Comfort Tyler, whose engineering skill contributed to regional development, arrived four years later. All three settled in Onondaga Hollow south of the present city center, which was then marshy.\\nJesuit missionaries visiting the Syracuse region in the mid 1600s reported salty brine springs around the southern end of \"Salt Lake\", known today as Onondaga Lake. The 1788 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, and the subsequent designation of the area by the state of New York as the Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation provided the basis for commercial salt production from the late 1700s through the early 1900s; brine from wells that tapped into halite(common salt) beds in the Salina shale near Tully, New York, 15 miles south of the city were developed in the 19th century. It is the north flowing brine from Tully that is the source of salt for the \"salty springs\" found along the shoreline of Onondaga lake. The rapid development of this industry in the 18th and 19th centuries led to the nicknaming of Syracuse as \"The Salt City\".\\n\\n\\n== 19th century ==\\n\\nThe original settlement of what today is Syracuse went through several name changes until 1824, first being called Salt Point (1780), then Webster\\'s Landing (1786), Bogardus Corners (1796), Milan (1809), South Salina (1812), Cossits\\u2019 Corners (1814), and Corinth (1817). The U.S. Postal Service rejected the name Corinth upon its application for a post office, stating there was already a post office by this name in New York. Because of similarities such as a salt industry and a neighboring village named Salina, the name Syracuse was chosen, after Syracuse, Sicily.\\nIn 1825, the Village of Syracuse was officially incorporated. Five years later, the Erie Canal, which ran through the village, was completed. The Village of Syracuse and the Village of Salina were combined into the City of Syracuse on December 14, 1847. Harvey Baldwin was the first mayor of the new city.\\n\\n\\n=== Early industries ===\\nThe opening of the canal caused a steep increase in the sale of salt, not simply because of the improved and lower cost of transportation, but because the canal led New York farms to change from wheat to pork, and curing pork required salt. Until 1900 the bulk of the salt used in the United States came from Syracuse As salt production climbed, the processing became increasingly mechanized, and local industry became more generalized; population grew from 250 in 1820, to 5,000 in 1850, making it the twelfth largest city in the Union at that time.\\nThe first Solvay Process Company plant in the United States, was erected on the southeastern shore of Onondaga lake in 1884 and the village was given the name Solvay, New York to commemorate its inventor, Ernest Solvay. In 1861, he developed the ammonia-soda process for the manufacture of soda ash {anhydrous sodium carbonate, a rare chemical called natrite, to distinguish it from natural natron of antiquity} from brine wells dug in the southern end of Tully valley (as a source of sodium chloride) and limestone (as a source of calcium carbonate). The process was an improvement over the earlier Leblanc process. The Syracuse Solvay plant was the incubator for a large chemical industry complex owned by Allied Signal in Syracuse, the result of which made Onondaga Lake the most polluted in the nation.\\nSince the discovery of large deposits of natural sodium carbonateTrona in 1938, near Green River in Wyoming, the Solvay process became uneconomical and the Syracuse Solvay Process Company plant closed permanently in 1985. No such plants operate now in North America. However, throughout the rest of the world the Solvay process remains the major source of soda ash.\\nThe closing of the Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation in the early 1900s and the end to mining brine in the southern part of the Tully valley in the late 1900s closed the final chapter of salt mining in the Syracuse region, but groundwater flowing along the southeastern shore of Onondaga lake in Syracuse still allows salty water from a thousand feet below the southern Tully valley to flow by gravity feeding salt springs around the lake where the Salina shale contains no halite beds.\\n\\n\\n=== Abolitionism and the Underground Railroad ===\\nSyracuse became an active center for the abolitionist movement, due in large part to the influence of Gerrit Smith and a group allied with him, mostly associated with the Unitarian Church and their pastor The Reverend Samuel May in Syracuse, as well as with Quakers in nearby Skaneateles, supported as well by abolitionists in many other religious congregations. Prior to the Civil War, due to the work of Jermain Wesley Loguen and others in defiance of federal law, Syracuse was known as the \"great central depot on the Underground Railroad\". On October 1, 1851, William Henry, a freed slave known as \"Jerry\" was arrested under the Fugitive Slave Law. The anti-slavery Liberty Party was holding its state convention in the city, and when word of the arrest spread, several hundred abolitionists including Charles Augustus Wheaton broke into the city jail and freed Jerry. The event came to be widely known as the \"Jerry Rescue\". In the aftermath, the Congregationalist minister Samuel Ringgold Ward had to flee to Canada to escape persecution because of his participation.\\n\\n\\n=== Industry and education in the late 19th century ===\\nThe salt industry declined after the Civil War, but a new manufacturing industry arose in its place.\\nThroughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, numerous businesses and stores were established, including the Franklin Automobile Company, which produced the first air-cooled engine in the world; the Century Motor Vehicle Company; and the Craftsman Workshops, the center of Gustav Stickley\\'s handmade furniture empire.\\nSyracuse University was chartered in 1870 as a Methodist-Episcopal institution.\\nThe Geneva Medical College was founded in 1834. It is now known as Upstate Medical University, the most prestigious medical college in the Syracuse area, one of only four in the State University of New York system, and one of only five medical schools in the state north of New York City.\\n\\n\\n== 20th century ==\\n\\nBy the 20th century, Syracuse University was no longer sectarian and had grown from a few classrooms located in downtown Syracuse into a major research institution. It is nationally recognized for its college basketball, college football, and college lacrosse teams. In 1911, under the leadership of Syracuse University trustee, Louis Marshall, the New York State College of Forestry was reestablished in close association with Syracuse University; it since has evolved into the SUNY-ESF. Le Moyne College was founded in 1946; Onondaga Community College in 1962.\\nWorld War II sparked significant industrial expansion in the area: specialty steel, fasteners, custom machining. After the war, two of the Big Three automobile manufacturers (General Motors & Chrysler) had major operations in the area. Syracuse was headquarters for Carrier Corporation, Crouse-Hinds traffic signal manufacturing, and General Electric had its main television manufacturing plant at Electronics Parkway in Syracuse.\\nSyracuse\\'s population peaked at 221,000 in 1950. That year, the Census Bureau reported Syracuse\\'s population as 97.7% White and 2.1% African American. Immigration from abroad introduced many ethnic groups to the city, particularly German, Irish, Italian, and Polish. African Americans had lived in Syracuse since Revolutionary War days, but between 1940 and 1960, some of the three million African Americans who migrated from the south to northern cities also settled in Syracuse. In the 1980s, many immigrants from Africa and Central America also moved to Syracuse, as they did to many northern cities \\u2014 sometimes under the auspices of several religious charities. However, these new Syracusans could not make up for the flow of residents out of Syracuse, either to its suburbs or out of state, due to job loss. The city\\'s population slowly decreases every year.\\nMuch of the city fabric changed after World War II, although Pioneer Homes, one of the earliest government housing projects in the US, had been completed earlier, in 1941. Many of Syracuse\\'s landmark buildings were demolished in the 1950s and 1960s. The federal Urban Renewal program cleared large sectors that remained undeveloped for many decades, although several new museums and government buildings were built.\\nThe manufacturing industry in Syracuse began to falter in the 1970s. Many small businesses failed during this time, which contributed to an already increasing unemployment rate. Rockwell International moved their factory outside New York state. General Electric moved its television manufacturing operations to Suffolk, Virginia and later to Singapore. The Carrier Corporation moved its headquarters out of Syracuse and outsourced manufacturing to Asian locations. Nevertheless, although city population has declined since 1950, the Syracuse metropolitan area population has remained fairly stable, even growing by 2.5 percent since 1970. While this growth rate is greater than much of Upstate New York, it is far below the national average during that period.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==', u\"1939 New York World's Fair\": u'The 1939\\u201340 New York World\\'s Fair, which covered the 1,216 acres (492 ha) of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park (also the location of the 1964\\u20131965 New York World\\'s Fair), was the second largest American world\\'s fair of all time, exceeded only by St. Louis\\'s Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904. Many countries around the world participated in it, and over 44 million people attended its exhibits in two seasons. The NYWF of 1939\\u20131940 was the first exposition to be based on the future, with an opening slogan of \"Dawn of a New Day\", and it allowed all visitors to take a look at \"the world of tomorrow\". According to the official New York World\\'s Fair pamphlet,\\n\\nThe eyes of the Fair are on the future \\u2014 not in the sense of peering toward the unknown nor attempting to foretell the events of tomorrow and the shape of things to come, but in the sense of presenting a new and clearer view of today in preparation for tomorrow; a view of the forces and ideas that prevail as well as the machines.\\nTo its visitors the Fair will say: \"Here are the materials, ideas, and forces at work in our world. These are the tools with which the World of Tomorrow must be made. They are all interesting and much effort has been expended to lay them before you in an interesting way. Familiarity with today is the best preparation for the future.\\n\\n\\n== Planning ==\\n\\nIn 1935, at the height of the Great Depression, a group of New York City businessmen decided to create an international exposition to lift the city and the country out of depression. Not long after, these men formed the New York World\\'s Fair Corporation, whose office was placed on one of the higher floors in the Empire State Building. The NYWFC elected former chief of police Grover Whalen as the president of their committee. The committee included Winthrop Aldrich, Mortimer Buckner, Floyd Carlisle, Ashley T. Cole, John J. Dunnigan, Harvey Dow Gibson, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, Percy S. Straus, and many other business leaders.\\nOver the next four years, the committee planned, built, and organized the fair and its exhibits, with countries around the world taking part in creating the biggest international event since World War I. Working closely with the Fair\\'s committee was Robert Moses, New York City Parks Commissioner, who saw great value to the City in having the World\\'s Fair Corporation (at its expense) remove a vast ash dump in Queens that was to be the site for the exposition. This event turned the area into a City park after the exposition closed.\\nEdward Bernays directed public relations of the fair in 1939, which he called \\'democricity\\'. Grover Whalen, a public relations innovator, saw the Fair as an opportunity for corporations to present consumer products, rather than as an exercise in presenting science and the scientific way of thinking in its own right, as Harold Urey, Albert Einstein and other scientists wished to see the project. \"As events transpired,\" reported Carl Sagan, whose own interest in science was nevertheless sparked by the Fair\\'s gadgetry, \"almost no real science was tacked on to the Fair\\'s exhibits, despite the scientists\\' protests and their appeals to high principles.\"\\nPromotion of this great event took many forms. In 1938, the Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants, and New York Yankees baseball teams did their part to promote the upcoming fair by wearing patches on their jerseys featuring the Trylon, Perisphere, and \"1939\" on their left sleeve. Howard Hughes flew a special World\\'s Fair flight around the world to promote the fair in 1938.\\nWhile the main purpose of the fair was to lift the spirits of the United States and drive much-needed business to New York City, it was also felt that there should be a cultural or historical association. It was therefore decided that the fair opening would correspond to the 150th anniversary of George Washington\\'s first inauguration as President of the United States, and the WPA painted murals which appeared in the New York Times Magazine.\\n\\n\\n== Grand opening ==\\n\\nOn April 30, 1939, a very hot Sunday, the fair had its grand opening, with 206,000 people in attendance. The April 30 date coincided with the 150th anniversary of George Washington\\'s inauguration as President in New York City. Although many of the pavilions and other facilities were not quite ready for this opening, it was put on with pomp and great celebration.\\nDavid Sarnoff, then president of RCA and a strong advocate of television, chose to display a TV set at the opening of the World\\'s Fair for the world to see. Before the fair, they had published a brochure for their dealers to explain television. As a reflection of the wide range of technological innovation on parade at the fair, Franklin D. Roosevelt\\'s speech was not only broadcast over the various radio networks but also was televised along with other parts of the opening ceremony and other events at the fair. Roosevelt was seen on black and white television sets with 5-inch tubes. NBC used the event to inaugurate regularly scheduled television broadcasts in New York City over their station W2XBS (now WNBC). An estimated 1,000 people viewed the Roosevelt telecast on about 200 television sets scattered throughout the New York area.\\nIn order to convince skeptical visitors that the television sets were not a trick, one set was made with a transparent case so that the internal components could be seen. As part of the exhibit, visitors could see themselves on television. After this formal introduction of television sets, they became widely available for the public.\\nIn addition to Roosevelt\\'s speech, Albert Einstein gave a speech which discussed cosmic rays. This was followed by the ceremonial lighting of the fair\\'s lights. Dignitaries received a special Opening Day Program which contained their names written in Braille.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibits ==\\n\\nOne of the first exhibits to receive attention was the Westinghouse Time Capsule, which was not to be opened for 5,000 years (the year 6939). The time capsule was a tube containing writings by Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann, copies of Life Magazine, a Mickey Mouse watch, a Gillette safety razor, a kewpie doll, a dollar in change, a pack of Camel cigarettes, millions of pages of text on microfilm, and much more. The capsule also contained seeds of foods in common use at the time: (wheat, corn, oats, tobacco, cotton, flax, rice, soy beans, alfalfa, sugar beets, carrots and barley, all sealed in glass tubes). The time capsule is located at 40\\xb044\\u203234.089\\u2033N 73\\xb050\\u203243.842\\u2033W, at a depth of 50 feet (15 m). A small stone plaque marks the position.\\nWestinghouse also featured \"Electro the Moto-Man\": the 7-foot (2.1 m) tall robot that talked, differentiated colors, and even \"smoked\" cigarettes.\\nOther exhibits included Vermeer\\'s painting The Milkmaid from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, a streamlined pencil sharpener, a diner (still in operation as the White Mana in Jersey City, New Jersey), a futuristic car based city by GM and early televisions. There was also a huge globe/planetarium located near the center of the fair. Bell Labs\\' Voder, a keyboard-operated speech synthesizer, was demonstrated at the Fair.\\nOn July 3, 1940 the fair hosted \"Superman Day.\" Notable was the crowning of the \"Super-Boy and Super-Girl of the Day\" following an athletic contest, and a public appearance by Superman, played by an unidentified man. Broadway actor Ray Middleton, who served as a judge for the contest, is often credited with having appeared in the Superman costume on Superman Day, but he did not. (Middleton may, however, have played Superman during a live radio broadcast from the scene.) Although the unknown man in the costume is often said to have been the first actor ever to play Superman, Bud Collyer had been performing the role on the Superman radio series since the preceding February.\\nOther firsts at the Fair included color photography, nylon, air conditioning, fluorescent lamps, the View-Master, and Smell-O-Vision.\\nThe fair was also the occasion for the 1st World Science Fiction Convention, subsequently dubbed Nycon 1.\\nRalph Vaughan Williams composed his work for harp and string orchestra Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus on commission from the World\\'s Fair. The first performance was at Carnegie Hall in June 1939, conducted by Adrian Boult.\\nThe British Council commissioned a piano concerto from Arthur Bliss for the British Week at the World\\'s Fair. Adrian Boult conducted the New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra in Carnegie Hall on June 10, 1939 with Solomon as the soloist.\\nCeramic sculptor Waylande Gregory created The Fountain of the Atom, which displayed the largest ceramic sculptures in modern times. It included the four Elements, each measuring 72 inches (180 cm) high and each weighing over a ton. There were also eight electrons, which were illustrated in Life Magazine (March 1939). Gregory also created two exhibitions featuring his ceramic sculptures for the General Motors Building, American Imports and American Exports.\\n\\n\\n== Themes and zones ==\\n\\nThe fair was divided into differently themed zones, such as the Transportation Zone, the Communications and Business Systems Zone, the Food Zone, the Government Zone, and so forth. Virtually every structure erected on the fairgrounds was extraordinary, and many of them were experimental in many ways. Architects were encouraged by their corporate or government sponsors to be creative, energetic and innovative. Novel building designs, materials and furnishings were the norm.\\nMany of the zones were arranged in a semi-circular pattern centered on the Theme Center. The zones were distinguished by many color cues, including different wall colors and tints and differently colored lighting.\\nThe Theme Center consisted of two all-white, landmark monumental buildings named the Trylon (over 700 feet (210 m) tall) and the Perisphere which one entered by a moving stairway and exited via a grand curved walkway named the \"Helicline\". Inside the Perisphere was a model city of tomorrow that visitors viewed from a moving walkway high above the floor level. The Theme Center was designed by the architect Wallace Harrison and his associate Max Abramovitz.\\nThe colors blue and orange were chosen as the official colors of the fair, as they were the colors of New York City, and featured prominently. Only the Trylon and Perisphere were all white; avenues stretching out into the zones from the Theme Center were designed with rich colors that changed the further one walked from the center of the grounds. For example, the exhibits and other facilities along the Avenue of Pioneers were in a progression of blues, starting with pale tints and ending in deep ultramarine. At night, with the latest in lighting technology switched on, the effect was felt by many visitors to be a magical experience.\\nOutdoor public lighting was at the time of a very limited and pedestrian nature, perhaps consisting of simple incandescent pole lamps in a city and nothing in the country. Electrification was still very new and had not reached everywhere in the US. The fair was the first public demonstration of several lighting technologies that would become common in future decades. These technologies included the introduction of the first fluorescent light and fixture. General Electric Corporation held the patent to the fluorescent light bulb at the time. Approximately a year later, the original three major corporations, Lightolier, Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation, and Globe Lighting, located mostly in the New York City region, began wide-scale manufacturing in the US of the fluorescent light fixture.\\nAnother theme of the fair was the emerging new middle class, leading a hoped-for recovery from the Great Depression. The fair promoted the \"Middleton Family\" \\u2014 Babs, Bud, and their parents appeared in ads showing them taking in the sights of the fair and the new products being manufactured to make life easier and affordable, such as the new automatic dishwasher.\\nEach day at the fair was a special theme day. For example, May 18, 1939 was \"Asbury Park, New Jersey Day\". For each day, a special button was issued. Some of these buttons are very rare today and all are very collectible.\\nIn 1940, the theme of the fair was changed to \"For Peace and Freedom\" as war in Europe escalated. One poster from that year\\'s fair, issued by Borden\\'s Milk, had Elsie the Cow proclaiming \"makes you proud to be an American\".\\n\\n\\n=== Transportation Zone ===\\n\\nWith its vast area and prominent location just south of the Theme Center, the Transportation Zone pavilions attracted widespread attention. Perhaps the most popular of the Transportation Zone pavilions was the one built for General Motors. There the 36,000 square foot (3,300 m\\xb2) Futurama exhibit, designed by famed industrial designer and theater set designer Norman Bel Geddes, transported fair visitors over a huge diorama of a fictional section of the United States that was designed with a stunning array of miniature highways, towns, 500,000 individually designed homes, 50,000 miniature vehicles, waterways, and a million miniature trees of diverse species. These elements of the diorama gradually became larger as the visitors, seated in chairs overhead, moved through the exhibit, until the cars and other elements of the exhibit became life-size.\\nAt the conclusion of the ride the visitors to the pavilion exited into an area that was constructed as a life-size city intersection with multistory buildings and stores on all sides. The stores included an auto dealership and an appliance store where visitors could see the latest GM and Frigidaire products. As with almost all pavilions in the fair, these showcases were not only intended to get people to buy the sponsor\\'s products, they were also intended to educate and inform the populace about basic materials and processes that were then very new and not well known. Many experimental product concepts and new materials were shown that were not currently available for purchase, but would become available in various ways over the next few years. In many ways the fair pavilions more resembled a modern-day government-sponsored science fair exhibit than they would resemble modern corporate advertising and sales promotions.\\nAdjacent to the GM pavilion was the Ford Pavilion, where race car drivers drove on a figure eight track on the building\\'s roof endlessly, day in and day out. Not far from GM and Ford was the Chrysler exhibit group, where an audience in a theater with air conditioning, then a new technology, could watch a Plymouth being assembled in an early 3D film.\\nRailroads were a major form of transportation for both passengers and freight in 1939, as airlines are for passengers today. Many visitors to the fair would have arrived in New York by railroad, and most visitors had at least a moderate interest in the topic. The centerpiece of the Railroad Conference exhibits (on seventeen acres) was \"Railroads on Parade,\" a spectacular live drama re-enacting the birth and growth of railroads. In addition to the show, there were important historical objects on display by the various railroads and manufacturing companies, such as the Tom Thumb engine. The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) had its S1 engine on display, mounted on rollers under the driver wheels and running continuously at 60 mph (97 km/h) all day long. The British London Midland & Scottish Railway sent their Coronation Scot express train with a locomotive LMS Princess Coronation Class 6229 Duchess of Hamilton, (disguised as sister locomotive 6220 Coronation), to the fair. GM\\'s Electro-Motive Division had a display of their then new streamlined diesel-electric passenger locomotives.\\n\\n\\n=== Communications and Business Systems Zone ===\\nA visitor walking to the left of the Theme Center on the Avenue of Patriots would visit the Communications and Business Systems focal exhibits. At the AT&T Pavilion the Voder, a mechanized, synthetic voice, spoke to attendees, foretelling the widespread use of electronic voices decades later.\\nAt the IBM pavilion, electric typewriters and a fantastic machine called the \"electric calculator\" that used punched cards, were on display. IBM also had a fine art gallery with hundreds of artworks from 70 countries around the world. The exhibit for Firestone Tires featured the famous pygmy hippo, Billy, who had been a pet of former US President Calvin Coolidge.\\nNext door to these business exhibits was the \"Masterpieces of Art\" building housing 300 priceless works of the Old Masters, from the Middle Ages to 1800. Whalen and his team were able to borrow priceless paintings and sculptures from Europe and hang them in a graceful, understated building in Queens for two years. Thirty five galleries featured great works from DaVinci and Michelangelo to Rembrandt, from Hals to Caravaggio and Bellini.\\n\\n\\n=== Government Zone ===\\nThe 60 foreign governments that participated in the fair contributed a wide diversity of creatively designed pavilions housing a stunning array of cultural offerings to fairgoers. The Italian pavilion attempted to fuse ancient Roman splendor with modern styles, and a 200-foot (61 m) high waterfall defined the pavilion\\'s facade. Its popular restaurant was designed in the shape of the nation\\'s luxury cruise line ships. The French pavilion, on the Court of Peace that was the grand open space northeast of the Theme Center, ran such a celebrated restaurant that after the fair closed and World War II ended, the restaurant remained in New York City. It soon established itself as one of the finest French dining establishments in the city: Le Pavillon.\\n\\n\\n==== British Pavilion ====\\n\\nThe copy of Magna Carta belonging to Lincoln Cathedral also left Britain in 1939 for the first time to be in the British Pavilion at the fair. Within months Britain joined World War II and it was deemed safer for it to remain in America until the end of hostilities. It therefore remained in Fort Knox, next to the original copy of the American constitution, until 1947.\\n\\n\\n==== USSR Pavilion ====\\n\\nExhibitions in the USSR Pavilion included the life-size copy of the interior of the showcase Mayakovskaya station of the Moscow Metro. Designer of the station Alexey Dushkin was awarded Grand Prize of the 1939 New York World\\'s Fair.\\n\\n\\n==== Jewish Palestine Pavilion ====\\n\\nThe Jewish Palestine Pavilion introduced the world to the concept of a modern Jewish state, which a decade later would become Israel. The pavilion featured on its fa\\xe7ade a monumental hammered copper relief sculpture titled The Scholar, The Laborer, and the Toiler of the Soil by the noted Art Deco sculptor Maurice Ascalon.\\n\\n\\n==== Polish Pavilion ====\\nSecond Polish Republic prepared some 200 tons of various works of art. In mid-February 1939, all items were transported by train to the port of Gdynia, where they were loaded on MS Batory, which left Gdynia on February 28. Among most important items, presented by Poland in New York City, were: a royal carpet of King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk, seven paintings presenting important events of Polish history, 150 contemporary Polish paintings, a gunmetal monument of Jozef Pilsudski, an armor of a Polish hussar from Kornik Castle, ancient Polish weaponry (14th - 18th centuries), a bell manufactured for the purpose of the Fair, folk costumes, house furniture from different regions of Poland and examples of Polish inventions.\\n\\n\\n=== Food Zone ===\\nContinuing outward from the Theme Center one saw the Food Zone. Among the many unique exhibits was the Borden\\'s exhibit, that featured 150 pedigreed cows (including the original Elsie) on a Rotolactor that allowed bathing them, drying them, and milking them in a highly mechanized way. While no such complete system has ever become common in milk production, many of its features are in everyday use in today\\'s rotary milking parlors.\\nNext door was the Continental Baking exhibit, presenting a vast, continuous process of baking breads and other products. Consistent with the representative design sense of the Fair, this building was fashioned in the shape of a huge packaged bread loaf, white with red, yellow, and blue balloons on its curved facade. Americans today will recognize this as the packaging for Wonder Bread. Behind the exhibit was a field from which wheat was harvested and used in the baking process. There was a sign in the field that noted that this was the first time in over 100 years that wheat had been grown within the incorporated bounds of New York City.\\n\\n\\n=== Amusement Area ===\\n\\nBeyond the corporate and government zones, the wildly popular but less uplifting Amusements Area was not integrated into the thematic matrix, and was a mere Area rather than a Zone. Despite the high-minded educational tone that Grover Whalen attempted to set, the Amusements Area was the most popular part of the Fair, and included a roller coaster, the Life Savers parachute jump (later moved to Coney Island, where it still stands today), the 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge Gimbels Flyer train ride (later purchased by Kennywood, where it still runs today), and carnival acts such as a collection of performing dwarves.\\nFrank Buck exhibited his \"Frank Buck\\'s Jungleland,\" which displayed rare birds, reptiles and wild animals along with Jiggs, a five-year-old trained orangutan. In addition, Buck provided a trio of performing elephants, an 80-foot (24 m) \"monkey mountain\" with 600 monkeys, and an attraction that had been popular at the 1893 Chicago World\\'s Fair: camel rides. A number of the shows provided spectators with the opportunity of viewing women in very revealing costumes or topless, such as the \"Frozen Alive Girl\", the Living Pictures, and the Dream of Venus building. This last attraction was a pavilion designed by the Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dal\\xed which contained within it a number of unusual sculptures and statues as well as live nearly-nude performers posing as statues. While there were a number of protests by prominent politicians over the course of the fair about the \"low minded entertainment,\" and the New York Vice Squad raided shows in the area on several occasions, the public generally accepted this form of entertainment.\\n\\n\\n==== Bendix Lama Temple girlie show ====\\nThe Bendix Lama Temple was a 28,000-piece full-sized replica of the 1767 Potala temple in Jehol, Manchuria, commissioned and brought back by the industrialist and explorer Vincent Bendix. The Temple had previously been exhibited at the 1933 Chicago World\\'s Fair, called \"Century of Progress\". In New York, the Temple contained a girlie show.\\n\\n\\n==== Aquacade ====\\nThe Billy Rose Aquacade was a spectacular musical and water extravaganza foreshadowing the form of many popular Hollywood musicals in the ensuing years. The show was presented in a special amphitheater seating 10,000 people and included an orchestra to accompany the spectacular synchronized swimming performance. It featured Johnny Weismuller and Eleanor Holm, two of the most celebrated swimmers of the era, and dazzled fairgoers with its lighting and cascades and curtains of water, pumped in waterfalls at 8000 gallons a minute. The cost of admission was 80 cents.\\nThe Aquacade facility itself served as an entertainment venue in the park for many years afterward, including the 1964\\u201365 World\\'s Fair, but fell into disrepair in the 1980s and was finally demolished in 1996.\\n\\n\\n=== Good Neighbor Policy ===\\n\\nThe New York World\\'s Fair of 1939 was just the place to promote neighborly relations between the U.S. and Latin America. Placed against the backdrop of a growing Nazi threat, the World\\'s Fair was an attempt to escape from the looming prospect of war and to promote peace and interdependence between nations. With the fair boasting over 60 countries, with some coming from Latin America, this was the place to redefine negative Latin American stereotypes. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua and the Pan American Union were all represented at the World\\'s Fair. Each country seized the opportunity to showcase their country and to make it more appealing to those around the world, especially in the United States. In their bid to increase cultural awareness at the World\\'s Fair, the countries promoted tourism and strived to compare itself to the United States in an effort to appeal to Americans.\\n\\n\\n== Transportation ==\\nA special subway line, the IND World\\'s Fair Line, was built to serve the fair. World\\'s Fair (now Mets \\u2013 Willets Point) station on the IRT Flushing Line was rebuilt to handle fair traffic on the IRT and BMT. A Long Island Rail Road station (now Mets \\u2013 Willets Point) was built next to the Flushing Line station. The IND extension departed the IND Queens Boulevard Line east of the Forest Hills \\u2013 71st Avenue station and before the 75th Avenue station. The World\\'s Fair station was at the east side of the Meadowlands at Horace Harding Boulevard. The period system route map and Fair maps display this temporary extension. The World\\'s Fair station was a terminus of the G train (alternate E trains also ran to World\\'s Fair Station), and ran at ground level, separated from the Fair grounds by a fence, past the Jamaica Yard (which is still in use).\\nFor the 1939\\u201340 Fair, a special fleet of 50 \"World\\'s Fair Steinway\" cars were delivered in late 1938 by the St. Louis Car Company for Flushing Line service. One (5655) survives in the New York Transit Museum fleet.\\n\\n\\n== Closure ==\\n\\nThe fair was open for two seasons, from April to October each year, and was officially closed forever on October 27, 1940. To get the fair\\'s budget overruns under control before the 1940 season and augment gate revenues, the fair management in the second year replaced Whalen with a banker, Harvey Gibson, and placed much greater emphasis on the amusement features and less on the educational and uplifting exhibits. The great fair attracted over 45 million visitors and generated roughly $48 million in revenue. Since the Fair Corporation had invested 67 million dollars (in addition to nearly a hundred million dollars from other sources), it was a financial failure, and the corporation declared bankruptcy.\\nThe Unisphere, built as the theme symbol for the 1964/1965 World\\'s Fair, stands on the site occupied by the Perisphere during the earlier Fair.\\n\\n\\n=== World War II ===\\nAlthough the United States would not enter the Second World War until the end of 1941, the fairgrounds served as a window into the troubles overseas. The pavilions of Poland and Czechoslovakia, for example, did not reopen for the 1940 season. Also on 4 July that same year, two New York City Police Department officers were killed by a blast while investigating a time bomb left at the British Pavilion.\\nCountries under the thumb of the Axis powers in Europe in 1940 like Poland, Czechoslovakia, and France ran their pavilions with a special nationalistic pride. The only major world power that did not participate for the 1939 season was Germany, citing budget pressures. The USSR Pavilion was dismantled after the first season, leaving an empty lot called \"The American Commons\". When the fair closed, many among the European staff were unable to return to their home countries, so they remained in the US and in some cases exercised a tremendous influence on American culture. For example, Henri Soul\\xe9 moved from the French Pavilion at the fair to open Le Pavillon restaurant, retaining Pierre Franey as head chef.\\nWorld War II presented additional problems with what to do with the exhibits on display in the pavilions of countries under Axis occupation. In the case of the Polish Pavilion, most of the items were sold by the Polish Government in exile in London to the Polish Museum of America and shipped to Chicago. A notable exception was made for a monument of the Polish-Lithuanian King Jagie\\u0142\\u0142o to which Mayor Fiorello La Guardia took such a liking that he helped spearhead a campaign to have it installed in Central Park, where it still stands today.\\n\\n\\n=== Belgian Pavilion ===\\n\\nAnother building saved from 1940 was the Belgian Building designed by Henry Van de Velde. It was awarded to Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia, and shipped to Richmond in 1941. The school still uses the building for its home basketball games. (\"Virginia Union University | Belgium Building.\" Virginia Union University | Belgium Building. Virginia Union University. Web. 2 Nov. 2014. <http://www.vuu.edu/about_vuu/campus_tour/belgium_building.aspx>.)\\n\\n\\n=== Bendix Lama Temple ===\\nAfter the Fair, the Temple was again disassembled, and placed in storage for many years. There were proposals to erect it at Oberlin College, Harvard University, Indiana University, and elsewhere, but they all failed for lack of funding. In 1984, the approximately 28,000 pieces were shipped to the Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm, Sweden, with plans to rebuild it in a nearby park. Objections from the neighboring Chinese Embassy have stalled the project indefinitely.\\n\\n\\n=== New York City Pavilion ===\\nSome of the buildings from the 1939 fair were used for the first temporary headquarters of the United Nations from 1946 until it moved in 1951 to its permanent headquarters in Manhattan. The former New York City building was used for the UN General Assembly during that time. This building was later refurbished for the 1964 fair as the New York City Pavilion, featuring the Panorama of the City of New York, an enormous scale model of the entire city. It is the only building from the 1939\\u201340 fair which survives in its original location. It became the home of the Queens Center for Art and Culture (later renamed the Queens Museum of Art, and now called the Queens Museum), which still houses and occasionally updates the Panorama.\\n\\n\\n== Influence on later literature and popular culture ==\\n\\nThe 1939 World\\'s Fair made a strong impression on attendees and influenced a generation of Americans. Later generations have attempted to recapture the impression it made in fictional and artistic treatments.\\n\\n\\n=== In film ===\\nThe still under-construction fair appeared in the finale of The Giggling Ghosts (1938).\\nIn the film, Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941) a comedy directed by Alfred Hitchcock, Carole Lombard and Gene Raymond visit the fair after a dinner date and find themselves stuck high in the air on the fair\\'s popular parachute ride when it malfunctions.\\n\\n\\n=== In literature ===\\nE.B. White recounts a visit to the fair in his 1939 essay \"The World of Tomorrow\".\\nThe still under-construction fair was the focus of the entire book The World\\'s Fair Goblin (1939), which was written in the fall of 1938 after the editors and authors were given a private fact-finding/research tour of the fair. The original draft of The World\\'s Fair Goblin was called The Man of Tomorrow, but it was considered better advertising to include the World\\'s Fair name in the title.\\nDC Comics published a 1939 New York World\\'s Fair Comics comic book, followed by a 1940 edition in the next year. It became the precursor of the long-running Superman/Batman team-up book World\\'s Finest Comics. The 1939 and 1940 comics were sometimes referenced in All-Star Squadron. Early Superman was described as a result of natural evolution from the inhabitants of his native world, leading to his alias \"Man of Tomorrow\", which reminds one of the \"World of Tomorrow\" theme of the Fair.\\nDoc Savage, a popular fictional character of the Pulp Era who used scientific detection in his adventures, was seen as a perfect match for the fair\\'s \"world of the future\" concept. President Grover Whalen to do a Grand Opening cross promotion with the publisher, Street & Smith.\\nIn the novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay (2000) by Michael Chabon, one of the main characters breaks into the abandoned fairgrounds and the Perisphere.\\nThe fair is featured prominently in the graphic novel Whatever Happened to the World of Tomorrow? by Brian Fies. In it, a father takes his young son to the fair which inspires him to a lifelong fascination with the promise of a hopeful, wonder-filled future.\\n\\n\\n=== In music ===\\n\"Fifty Years After the Fair\", written and recorded by Aimee Mann, describes the Fair from the current vantage point of \"tomorrow\", with a mixture of nostalgia and remorse.\\n\\n\\n=== In restaurants ===\\nThree august French restaurants - La Caravelle, Le Pavillon, and La C\\xf4te Basque - were offshoots \"of the seminal restaurant in the French pavilion of the 1939 New York World\\'s Fair, where Charles Masson p\\xe8re began as a waiter under the eye of the legendary Henri Soul\\xe9\".\\n\\n\\n=== In television ===\\nThe Pinky and the Brain episode \"Mice Don\\'t Dance\" (3-11a), takes place in the 1939 World\\'s Fair.\\nThe Twilight Zone Season 2 episode, \"The Odyssey of Flight 33\", follows Flight 33 lost in time and briefly in 1939, with a sky view of the World\\'s Fair. However, the pilot incorrectly identifies the location as Lake Success, which actually is in Nassau County, not Queens County.\\n\\n\\n== Archives ==\\nAn archive of documents and films from the 1939 New York World\\'s Fair is maintained at the New York Public Library (NYPL). This collection of official corporate records from the fair is one of the richest and most heavily used collections at NYPL. Extensive highlights from the collection can be viewed online, or via an award-winning free iPad app.\\nIn October 2010, the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. opened an exhibition titled Designing Tomorrow: America\\u2019s World\\u2019s Fairs of the 1930s. This exhibition, which was available for view until September 2011, prominently featured the New York World\\'s Fair.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n1964 New York World\\'s Fair \\u2014 later World\\'s Fair on the same site\\nFlushing Meadows\\u2013Corona Park \\u2014 current park area on which the World\\'s Fairs were held\\nList of world expositions\\nList of world\\'s fairs\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Notes ===\\n\\n\\n=== Further reading ===\\nJames Mauro (2010).

The present Vanity Fair has been published since 1983 and there have been editions for four European countries as well as the U.S. edition. This revived the title whose last title publication was February 1936 after a run from 1913. The current editor is Graydon Carter.\\n\\n\\n== Cond\\xe9 Nast\\'s Vanity Fair ==\\n\\nCond\\xe9 Montrose Nast began his empire by purchasing the men\\'s fashion magazine Dress in 1913. He renamed the magazine Dress and Vanity Fair and published four issues in 1913. It continued to thrive into the twenties. However, it became a casualty of the Great Depression and declining advertising revenues, although its circulation, at 90,000 copies, was at its peak. Cond\\xe9 Nast announced in December 1935 that Vanity Fair would be folded into Vogue (circulation 156,000) as of the March 1936 issue.\\n\\n\\n== Modern revival ==\\nCond\\xe9 Nast Publications, under the ownership of S.I. Newhouse, announced in June 1981 that it was reviving the magazine. The first issue was published in February 1983 (cover date March), edited by Richard Locke, formerly of The New York Times Book Review. After three issues, Locke was replaced by Leo Lerman, veteran features editor of Vogue. He was followed by editors Tina Brown (1984\\u20131992) and Graydon Carter (since 1992). Regular columnists have included Sebastian Junger, Michael Wolff, Maureen Orth and Christopher Hitchens. Famous contributing photographers for the magazine include Bruce Weber, Annie Leibovitz, Mario Testino and Herb Ritts, who have all provided the magazine with a string of lavish covers and full-page portraits of current celebrities. Amongst the most famous of these was the August 1991 Leibovitz cover featuring a naked, pregnant Demi Moore, an image entitled More Demi Moore that to this day holds a spot in pop culture.\\nIn addition to its controversial photography, the magazine also prints articles on a variety of topics. In 1996, journalist Marie Brenner wrote an expos\\xe9 on the tobacco industry titled \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\". The article was later adapted into a movie The Insider (1999), which starred Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Most famously, after more than thirty years of mystery, an article in the May 2005 edition revealed the identity of Deep Throat (W. Mark Felt), one of the sources for The Washington Post articles on Watergate, which led to the 1974 resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon. The magazine also features candid interviews with celebrities, including a monthly Proust Questionnaire. Other notable interviews have included: Teri Hatcher, who revealed in the magazine that she was sexually abused as a child; Jennifer Aniston\\'s first interview after her divorce from Brad Pitt; Anderson Cooper, who talked about his brother\\'s death; and Martha Stewart\\'s first interview after her release from prison.\\nIn August 2006, Vanity Fair sent photographer Annie Leibovitz to the Telluride, Colorado, home of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes for its October 2006 issue. The photo shoot was of the couple and their daughter, Suri Cruise, who had previously been \"hidden\", without pictures released to the public, causing many to start to deny her existence. This issue became the second highest selling issue for the magazine; the first was the Jennifer Aniston cover after her divorce. In December 2006, Vanity Fair featured the video portrait of Brad Pitt by director Robert Wilson on the cover of its first arts issue, marking the mainstream actor\\'s growing commitment to fine art.\\nThe magazine was the subject of Toby Young\\'s book, How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, about his search for success, from 1995, in New York working for Graydon Carter\\'s Vanity Fair. The book has been made into a movie, with Jeff Bridges playing Carter.\\n\\n\\n=== International editions ===\\nThere are currently four international editions of Vanity Fair being published, namely in the United Kingdom (started 1991), Spain, France, and Italy, with the Italian version published weekly. The British Vanity Fair was first published in 1991. The Italian Vanity Fair was established in 2003 and celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2013.\\nVanity Fair Germany launched in February 2007 at a cost of \\u20ac50 million, then the most expensive new magazine in Germany in years and Cond\\xe9 Nast\\'s biggest investment outside the United States. After circulation had plummeted from half a million to less than 200,000 per week, the German edition was shut down in 2009. A French version started in June 2013. The Spanish version of the magazine was first published in Spain in 2008 and it has been published monthly.\\n\\n\\n=== Vanity Fair Oscar Party ===\\nAs a successor to a similar invitation-only event annually held by the late agent Irving Paul Lazar, the first Vanity Fair Oscar Party took place in 1994. During its first years, the magazine\\'s Oscar party was co-hosted by producer Steve Tisch at Morton\\'s in West Hollywood. At first, editor Graydon Carter kept the invitation list small, at around 120 for dinner. Between 2009 and 2013, the party was held at Sunset Tower. The 2014 edition takes places in a temporary, 12,000-square-foot glass-walled structure at 8680 Sunset Boulevard. Vanity Fair makes a limited number of invitations available each year for charity.\\n\\n\\n=== Bloomberg/Vanity Fair Party ===\\nIn recent years, Vanity Fair hosted, with Bloomberg, an after-party at the French ambassador\\u2019s house following the White House Correspondents\\' Association dinner.\\n\\n\\n=== Vanity Fair Confidential ===\\nIn 2013, Cond\\xe9 Nast struck a deal with Discovery Communications-owned cable channel Investigation Discovery for Vanity Fair Confidential, a crime and mystery documentary TV series based on stories from Vanity Fair magazine.\\n\\n\\n=== Online activities ===\\nVanity Fair launched a YouTube channel in July 2013. In anticipation of its 100th anniversary that year, Vanity Fair co-produced 10 short films, one to celebrate each decade, from well-known documentary filmmakers like Barbara Kopple and including the film producer Judd Apatow, and actors Don Cheadle and Bryce Dallas Howard.\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\n\\n\\n=== Controversial pictorials ===\\nSome of the pictorials in Vanity Fair have attracted criticism. The April 1999 issue featured an image of actor Mike Myers dressed as a Hindu deity for a photo spread by David LaChapelle: after criticism, both the photographer and the magazine apologized.\\nOn April 25, 2008, the televised entertainment program Entertainment Tonight reported that 15-year-old Miley Cyrus had posed topless for a photo shoot with Vanity Fair. The photo, and subsequently released behind-the-scenes photos, show Cyrus without a top, her bare back exposed but her front covered with a bedsheet. The photo shoot was taken by photographer Annie Leibovitz. The full photograph was published with an accompanying story on The New York Times\\' website on April 27, 2008. On April 29, 2008, The New York Times clarified that though the pictures left an impression that she was bare-breasted, Cyrus was wrapped in a bedsheet and was actually not topless. Some parents expressed outrage at the nature of the photograph, which a Disney spokesperson described as \"a situation [that] was created to deliberately manipulate a 15-year-old to sell magazines.\" In response to the internet circulation of the photo and ensuing media attention, Miley Cyrus released a statement of apology on April 27: \"I took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be \\'artistic\\' and now, seeing the photographs and reading the story, I feel so embarrassed. I never intended for any of this to happen and I apologize to my fans who I care so deeply about.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Polanski libel case ===\\nIn 2005, Vanity Fair was found liable in a lawsuit brought in the UK by film director Roman Polanski, who claimed the magazine had libelled him in an article published in 2002, and written by A. E. Hotchner. The article recounted a claim by Lewis H. Lapham, editor of Harper\\'s, that Polanski had made sexual advances towards a young model as he was travelling to the funeral of his wife, Sharon Tate, in August 1969, claiming that he could make her \"the next Sharon Tate\". The court permitted Polanski to testify via a video link, after he expressed fears that he might be extradited were he to enter the United Kingdom. The trial started on July 18, 2005, and Polanski made English legal history as the first claimant to give evidence by video link. During the trial, which included the testimonies of Mia Farrow and others, it was proved that the alleged scene at the famous New York restaurant Elaine\\'s could not possibly have taken place on the date given, because Polanski only dined at this restaurant three weeks later. Also, the Norwegian then-model disputed the accounts that he had claimed to be able to make her \"the next Sharon Tate\".\\nPolanski was awarded \\xa350,000 damages by the High Court in London. The case was notable because Polanski was living in France as a fugitive from U.S. justice, and never appeared in the London court for fear he would be extradited to the U.S. Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair, responded, \"I find it amazing that a man who lives in France can sue a magazine that is published in America in a British courtroom.\"\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nVanity Fair homepage\\nVanity Fair Mobile Blog Reader\\nVanity Fair homepage (UK)\\nVanity Fair homepage (Italy)\\nVanity Fair homepage (Spain)\\nVanity Fair \\u2013 magazine profile at Fashion Model Directory', u'Big Bend Gold Rush': u'The Big Bend Gold Rush was a gold rush on the upper Columbia River in the Colony of British Columbia (now a Canadian province) in the mid-1860s.\\nThe goldfield was located on tributaries of the Columbia in an area known as the Big Bend Country, named for the huge hairpin bend a few hundred miles long in eastern British Columbia formed by the Columbia as it curves around the Selkirk Mountains from the river\\'s source to the southeast in the Rocky Mountain Trench and turns southwards towards the Arrow Lakes and eventually the United States. The main finds were in the middle of the southward leg of the river\\'s journey out of the Big Bend proper, where the towns of Mica Creek and Big Bend marked the northward focus of the rush. The main part of the rush was nearer the Arrow Lakes, on creeks tributary to the Goldstream River and Downie Creek, which lay respectively immediately above and below the infamous Dalles des Morts or \"Death Rapids\" of the Columbia, which had been the scene of horrendous tragedies twice, in 1817 and 1838. The main town centres of the rush were at La Porte, British Columbia, at the foot of the rapids, and Downie Creek, nearby at that stream\\'s confluence with the Columbia just downstream from La Porte.\\n\\n\\n== Historical context ==\\nThe rush was a spin-off of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, the first of the major gold rushes which dominate the colony\\'s history, out from which the huge influx of miners from California on the Fraser fanned out into other regions of the colony in search of gold. Other rushes found in the same years were the Rock Creek, Wild Horse Creek, Cariboo, Omineca, and Stikine Gold Rushes, as well as the Colville and Colorado Gold Rushes which were manned by many who had been on the Fraser and such rushes as Big Bend.\\n\\n\\n== Access ==\\nThe story of the Big Bend Gold Rush is as much about the effort to get there - as with all British Columbia gold rushes - as it is about the rush itself, which was modest in terms of earnings in comparison to the Fraser and Cariboo, or to the later silver and galena rushes just south in the Slocan, West Kootenay and Boundary Districts. When the rush was discovered, the upper Columbia was extremely remote from any form of non-First Nations civilization in that period, although some who reached the Big Bend rush came overland up the Rocky Mountain Trench from what is now Montana, or via Washington Territory up the Columbia River itself. Impossibly far from the Fraser, which was itself very remote and difficult to get to from Victoria, or from the rest of the world.\\nThere were various routes into this area, as men had fanned out over the whole of British Columbia and adjoining US territories in the wake of the Fraser Gold Rush and had heard news of the rush from all directions. The Columbia route was mostly navigable and many came via that route. Regular steamboat service to La Porte, the head of navigation from Marcus, Washington Terr. began in 1866 (it was first attempted in 1865).. Most, however, came via a water route from the foot of Kamloops Lake, just east of Cache Creek and so near the main trails associated with the Fraser rush and the new goldfields being found north in the Cariboo. From there, steamer services travelled from Kamloops Lake via Fort Kamloops and up the South Thompson to reach Little Shuswap Lake and via the Little River to Shuswap Lake (also called, especially in the old days, Big Shuswap Lake). Shuswap Lake is one of the largest lakes in southern British Columbia, effectively an H-shaped series of four freshwater inlets, the northeast arm leading to the mouth of the short but powerful Seymour River. From there, a few passes including Pettipiece Pass led over wide cols in the Monashee Mountains to reach the Columbia, where other steamer services operated to the boomtown of Big Bend and to the mouths of the Goldstream River and Downie Creek.\\nThe first steamer service to the Big Bend operated from that location was owned by an Italian settler from California named Savona, and so the location became quickly known as Savona\\'s Ferry (today\\'s town of Savona).\\nIn later years, once the rush was over, the Big Bend became the route of the first road connecting what is now the province of Alberta to British Columbia, which remained in use until the building of the Trans-Canada Highway through the Rogers Pass. Most of the goldfields and what remained of their boomtowns and old mining camps and workings is now beneath the waters of the reservoirs of Mica Dam or Revelstoke Canyon Dam (the Mica Dam is one of the Columbia River Treaty dams).\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBritish Columbia Gold Rushes\\nGold rush\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nBritish Columbia Chronicle, 1847-1871: Gold & colonists, Helen and G.P.V.

It was the first single following the release of their debut album Dreamboat Annie, released in 1976 (two earlier Canadian singles had preceded the release of the album). Starting with an acoustic guitar intro called \"Silver Wheels\", the song turns into fast-paced rock song that was the signature sound of the band in their early years. \"Crazy on You\" attracted attention both for the relatively unusual combination of an acoustic guitar paired with an electric guitar, and the fact that the acoustic guitarist was a female \\u2013 a rarity in rock music during that time. According to co-writer/guitarist Nancy Wilson on an episode of In the Studio with Redbeard (which devoted an entire episode to the Dreamboat Annie album), the rapid acoustic rhythm part was inspired by The Moody Blues song \"Question\".\\nThe song\\'s lyrics tell of a person\\'s desire to forget all the problems of the world during one night of passion. During an interview on Private Sessions, Ann Wilson revealed the song was written in response to the stress caused by the Vietnam War and social unrest in the United States in the early seventies.\\n\"Crazy on You\" became the band\\'s first commercial hit, peaking at #35 on the charts in the summer of 1976. Despite its modest chart performance, \"Crazy on You\" remains one of Heart\\'s signature songs and is still a staple on U.S. classic rock radio stations. In late 1977, Mushroom Records re-released the single with the same catalog number and B-Side. This re-release peaked at #62 on the Hot 100 in early 1978. In the Netherlands it reached number two on the singles chart in March 1977. The single\\'s B-side, \"Dreamboat Annie\", was later released on its own as an A-side.\\nIn 2013, the original lineup of the band performed the song for their induction into the Rock n\\' Roll Hall of Fame, their first performance together in over thirty years.\\n\\n\\n== Chart performance ==\\n\\n\\n=== Original release ===\\n\\n\\n=== 1978 Re-issue ===\\n\\n\\n== Covers and appearances ==\\nIt is featured in 1981 Ralph Bakshi film American Pop.\\nIt is featured in the Shaun White snowboarding video \"The White Album\".\\nIt is featured in the 2006 video game Guitar Hero II.\\nIt is featured in the 2007 film Juno, and is mentioned in the credits.

It is the largest independent television franchise producing company in the UK accounting for 25% of the total broadcasting output of the ITV network. Previously it was held by Granada Television which was founded by Sidney Bernstein and based at Granada Studios on Quay Street in Manchester since its inception, and which was the only surviving company out of the original four Independent Television Authority franchisees from 1954 before it merged with Carlton Communications to form ITV plc in 2004. It covers Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside, northwestern Derbyshire, part of Cumbria and North Yorkshire, and on 15 July 2009, the Isle of Man was transferred to ITV Granada from ITV Border (even though the Isle of Man is a British Crown Dependency that is not part of the United Kingdom).\\nBroadcasting by Granada Television began on 3 May 1956 under the North of England weekday franchise and was marked by a distinctive northern identity including their famous stylised letter \"G\" logo forming an arrow pointing north, often with the tagline \"Granada: from the north\". Granada plc merged with Carlton Communications to form ITV plc in 2004 after a duopoly had developed over the previous decade. The Granada name, as with those of the other former Channel 3 regional licence holders, has completely disappeared except for the regional news bulletins and weeknightly regional news magazine as ITV Broadcasting Limited operates the service with national ITV branding and continuity. Granada Television Ltd still legally exists and is, along with most other regional companies owned by ITV plc, listed on www.companieshouse.gov.uk as a \"Dormant company\". Other companies listed are Granada Television International and Granada Television Overseas Ltd, but these are either dormant or non-trading.\\nThe North West region is regarded as ITV\\'s most successful franchise, and The Financial Times and The Independent once described Granada Television, the former franchise holder, as \\'the best commercial television company in the world\\'. Nine Granada programmes were listed in the BFI TV 100 in 2000 and some of its most notable programmes include Coronation Street, Seven Up!, The Royle Family, The Jewel in the Crown, Brideshead Revisited, World in Action, University Challenge and The Krypton Factor. Past employees include Paul Greengrass, Michael Apted, Mike Newell, Jeremy Isaacs, Andy Harries, Russell T Davies and Leslie Woodhead.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\nGranada Television, a subsidiary of Granada Ltd, originated in Granada Theatres Ltd, which owned cinemas in the south of England, founded in Dover in 1930 by Sidney Bernstein and his brother Cecil. The company was incorporated as Granada Ltd in 1934 and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1935; Granada Theatres Ltd became a subsidiary of the new company. It is named after the Spanish city, Granada.\\nThe Bernsteins became involved in commercial television, a competitor to the cinema chains. Bernstein bid for the North of England franchise, which he believed would not affect the company\\'s largely southern-based cinema chain. In 1954, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) awarded Granada the North of England contract for Monday to Friday, with ABC, serving the same area on weekends. The companies used the ITA\\'s Winter Hill and Emley Moor transmitters covering Lancashire and the West and East Ridings of Yorkshire, including the major conurbations around Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield and Doncaster.\\n\\nThe North and London were the two biggest regions. Granada preferred the North because of its tradition of home-grown culture, and because it offered a chance to start a new creative industry away from the metropolitan atmosphere of London ... the North is a closely knit, indigenous, industrial society; a homogeneous cultural group with a good record for music, theatre, literature and newspapers, not found elsewhere in this island, except perhaps in Scotland. Compare this with London and its suburbs\\u2014full of displaced persons. And, of course, if you look at a map of the concentration of population in the North and a rainfall map, you will see that the North is an ideal place for television\".\\n\\nBernstein selected a base from Leeds and Manchester. Granada executive Victor Peers believed Manchester was the preferred choice even before executives toured the region to find a suitable base. Granada Studios, designed by architect Ralph Tubbs, was built on a site on Quay Street in Manchester city centre belonging to Manchester City Council bought for \\xa382,000.\\nTransmissions began in Lancashire on 3 May 1956, and Yorkshire six months later. The opening night featured Meet The People hosted by Quentin Reynolds and comedian Arthur Askey. Reynolds became inebriated before the broadcast and had to sober up.\\n\\n\\n=== Early years ===\\n\\nMost ITV franchisees viewed their territories as mere stopgaps before winning a coveted London franchise. In contrast, Granada determined to develop a strong northern identity \\u2013 northern voices, northern programmes, northern idents with phrases such as Granada from the north, From the north\\u2014Granada and Granadaland. Bernstein refused to employ anyone not prepared to live in or travel to Manchester and Jeremy Isaacs called him a \\'genial tyrant\\' as a result.\\n\\nI think that what Manchester sees today, London will see eventually.\\n\\nBernstein decided to build new studios rather than hiring space or converting old buildings, an approach favoured by the other ITV companies and by the BBC at its original Manchester studios. The investment in new studios in 1954 contributed to Granada struggling financially and the company was close to insolvency by late 1956. All four ITA franchisees were expected to make losses in the first few years of operation but Granada\\'s was a significant sum of \\xa3175,000 (nearly \\xa33.5m in 2011) and when it became profitable it had the lowest profits of the quartet.\\nGranada sought the help of Associated-Rediffusion, the London weekday station, which agreed to underwrite Granada\\'s debts in exchange for a percentage of its profits, without the consent of the ITA, who would have blocked it. Granada accepted the deal, but the popularity of ITV increased and profitability followed. Analysts questioned how Associated-Rediffusion, ABC and ATV were making annual profits of up to \\xa32.7m by 1959 and yet Granada\\'s profits were under \\xa31m. With the increase in income, Granada attempted to renegotiate the contract; Associated-Rediffusion refused, souring relations for many years. The deal was worth over \\xa38m (2008: \\xa3129m) to Rediffusion. By the early 1960s Granada was established and its soap opera Coronation Street quickly became popular alongside inexpensive game shows Criss Cross Quiz and University Challenge.\\n\\n\\n=== Franchise changes ===\\nIn the 1968 franchise round, Granada\\'s contract was changed from weekdays across the northern England region to the whole week in the north west from Winter Hill transmitting station. Yorkshire became a separate region and the contract awarded to Yorkshire Television, broadcasting from Emley Moor transmitting station whose transmissions could be received in parts of North Lincolnshire. Bernstein was angered by the decision to split \"Granadaland\", and claimed he would appeal to the United Nations. Granada Television was now received in what is now Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside and Cheshire, the south of what is now Cumbria (then Lancashire) around Barrow-in-Furness, the High Peak district of Derbyshire (Glossop, Buxton) and parts of the Isle of Man. Parts of North Wales can receive only the Winter Hill transmissions (i.e. Granada) rather than HTV.\\nGranada retained its franchise in the 1980 franchise review, and invested in multi-million pound productions such as The Jewel in the Crown and Brideshead Revisited. By the late 1980s the UK commercial broadcasters were considered too small to compete in the world market and the ITV franchises began to consolidate with the aim of creating a single company with a larger budget.\\nThe Broadcasting Act of 1990 instigated the 1991 franchise auction round, in which companies had to bid for the regions. Mersey Television, a company producing the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside, bid \\xa335m compared to Granada\\'s \\xa39m but Granada won as Mersey\\'s package did not meet the \\'quality threshold\\' applied by the Independent Television Commission, a premise which disadvantaged companies with no previous franchise experience. Granada owned popular television series such as Coronation Street which it threatened to sell to satellite TV if the franchise was lost. The government responded by relaxing the regulatory regime, so that ITV contractors could take over other companies, and Granada bought several companies. Some at the company considered ITV could only survive as a single merged entity to have sufficient resources to produce big-budget programmes, a concern that increased when BSkyB began to take ITV\\'s viewing share, leading to less advertising revenue, the source of ITV\\'s income.\\nDavid Plowright, who had worked at Granada since 1957, resigned in 1992 citing the arrival of Gerry Robinson who tightened the departmental budget with an uncompromising business approach. Plowright was the company\\'s driving force producing programmes such as World in Action, Coronation Street and promoted the Granada Studios Tour. His departure angered well-known media-industry figures; John Cleese faxed Robinson using \\'vitriolic language\\' and called him an \\'upstart caterer\\', a reference to his past employment. John Birt, Harold Pinter and Alan Bennett all supported Plowright.\\n\\n\\n=== Takeover bids ===\\nThe so-called \\'Big 5\\' ITV franchisees, Thames, LWT, Central, Granada, and Yorkshire Television were expected to take over the ten smaller franchises. Granada wanted to consolidate with Yorkshire and Tyne Tees Television to \\'counter the potential dominance of the south east\\', and the prospect of being taken over by Thames Television. Granada made a hostile bid for LWT in December 1993, but LWT believed Granada had little to offer despite having three times the market capitalisation; Granada, however, completed the take-over in 1994. Granada continued to expand by acquiring Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television for \\xa3652m in 1997 and bought UNM\\'s television assets for \\xa31.75 billion in 2000 \\u2013 by which it acquired Anglia Television and Meridian Broadcasting and some divisions of HTV \\u2013 the remaining divisions passing to rival company Carlton due to competition laws. A year later, it acquired Border from Capital Radio Group.\\nBy 2002, Granada had established an effective duopoly of ITV with Carlton Television, owning all the ITV companies in England and Wales. The franchises in Scotland, (Scottish Television and Grampian Television), UTV in Northern Ireland, and Channel Television in the Channel Islands, remained independent.\\nGranada was in a poor financial state and closed the Granada Studios Tour in 2001 citing decreasing visitor figures, though the real reason was the decision for Coronation Street to increase to five episodes per week. Without access to the set, which was the highlight of the tour, the whole Granada Studios Tour venture became unviable. They also closed Granada Film. The emergence of digital television cut ITV\\'s viewing share, decreasing advertising revenue which was suffering from competition with the internet. The failure of ITV Digital affected Granada and Carlton with losses estimated at over \\xa31 billion reducing the company\\'s value from 2001 to 2003.\\n\\n\\n=== ITV Granada and the unification of ITV ===\\n\\nOn 28 October 2002, in a network-wide relaunch, Granada was rebranded as ITV1 Granada. The Granada name was shown before regional programmes, but this has ceased and it has vanished from screens as have all other ITV regional identities. Since rebranding, all continuity announcements are made from London. The Granada logo appeared at the end of its own programmes until 31 October 2004.\\nGranada was permitted by the government to merge with Carlton on 2 February 2004 to form ITV plc. The move was a takeover by Granada whose market capitalisation was double that of Carlton at nearly \\xa32 billion. Granada owned 68% of the shares and Carlton 32%; chairman designate Michael Green was ousted by shareholders and the majority of new board members originated from Granada. Carlton employees were subsumed in Granada operations or made redundant with three out of four new departments led by Granada staff.\\nFrom 1 November 2004, Granada productions were credited \"Granada Manchester\", the brand of the unified in-house production arm but on 21 September 2005 it was announced that Granada\\'s name would no longer appear at the end of programmes and the in-house production arm was renamed \\'ITV Productions\\'. The change on 16 January 2006 coincided with a relaunch of ITV\\'s on-screen graphics. Granada\\'s name and logo were used at the end of programmes made for other networks, such as University Challenge for BBC Two and old programmes shown on BSkyB channels 1, 2 and the former 3 (now Pick), until 2009.\\nIn November 2006, Granada lost its on-air identity when regional programming voiced ITV1 or ITV1 Granada over a generic ident. Local news coverage was branded Granada News except for the main 18.00 Granada Reports bulletin. Granada Reports\\u200a\\'\\u200b main rival is BBC North West Tonight, broadcast to roughly the same region. In 2009, ITV removed the Granada brand from all departments including its international production arm, Granada America which became ITV Studios America. End credits on programmes made at The Manchester Studios were credited to ITV Studios.\\n\\n\\n=== Present ===\\nITV made cutbacks with the loss of 600 jobs in 2009 which effectively closed the Yorkshire Television Leeds Studios and more redundancies made in London left Granada relatively unscathed. In the 2009 ITV regional news cutbacks, Granada was one of three regions unaffected by changes except for the addition of the Isle of Man.\\nITV is obliged by UK communications regulator Ofcom to produce 50% of programmes outside London, something it failed to achieve in 2007 and 2008. With this obligation, Manchester as the northern hub and an \\xa380m move to MediaCityUK on 25 March 2013, it would appear that ITV is committed to the Granada region for the foreseeable future.\\n\\n\\n== Studios ==\\n\\nIn the 18 months between the award of the franchise and the start of transmission, Granada built a brand new studio complex on Quay Street. It has been claimed that the site was previously a cemetery containing a pauper\\'s grave, where 22,000 people were buried. However an article in The Sun newspaper and an episode of the TV series Most Haunted seem to be the only sources for this so far. Twelve maps from between 1772 and 1960 show no evidence of a cemetery and buildings are shown on the bull china site from 1807. Part of the Manchester and Salford Junction Canal, which linked the River Irwell to the Rochdale Canal from 1839 to 1922, did however run in tunnel underneath the site. The studios pre-date BBC Television Centre by four years and were the first purpose-built television studios in the United Kingdom.\\nBernstein wanted to make Granada Television appear a close rival to the BBC and exaggerated the scale of the studios giving the floors only even numbers so that it appeared there were 12 floors in the building despite there only being six. The studios are operated by 3SixtyMedia, ITV Studios\\' joint-venture company with BBC Resources Ltd (now at BBC Manchester. The studios produce shows displaced by the closure of the Yorkshire Television studios in Leeds in 2009, including Channel 4\\'s Countdown.\\nIn September 2010, the 1950s famous red landmark \"Granada TV\" signs on the roof and entrance of Granada Studios on Quay Street were removed for safety reasons after maintenance found it was badly corroded. Some have claimed the sign will return to its \\'rightful place\\'. The Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) has registered an interest in inheriting the sign, deeming it important to Manchester\\'s cultural heritage.\\n\\n\\n=== Relocation ===\\n\\nAfter the ITV merger in 2004, the possibility of selling the Quay Street site was considered, with staff, studios and offices moved into the adjacent bonded warehouse building. ITV anticipated the BBC would buy the land but the BBC opted to move to the Peel Group\\'s MediaCityUK development in Salford Quays. ITV considered relocating to Trafford Wharf across the Manchester Ship Canal from the BBC at MediaCityUK and discussions continued for several years and an agreement in principle was reached in 2008. In March 2009, in the recession, Granada announced it would remain at Quay Street but after a change of management, talks resumed in January 2010. On 16 December 2010, Granada announced it would move to the Orange Building in MediaCityUK alongside the University of Salford and a studio to produce the ITV flagship soap opera Coronation Street would be built on the opposite bank of the ship canal on Trafford Wharf. Planning permission was granted and building work started on 6 September 2011 with the aim of completion in 2012. ITV Granada moved to MediaCityUK on 25 March 2013.\\n\\n\\n== Identity ==\\nThroughout its history, Granada used the logo of an arrow pointing northwards in idents often accompanied by a tagline \\'from the North\\'. Sidney Bernstein wanted to present a northern identity. Granada Television was considered bolder than other franchisees and the BBC, and placed great emphasis displaying the northern style which distinguished it from them. Bernstein believed the north had untapped creative energy that needed cultivation.\\nIn 1958, two years after its launch, Granada\\'s northern style was apparent. Kenneth Clark, of the Independent Television Authority (ITA) which let the franchise, remarked: \"We did not quite foresee how much Granada would develop a character which distinguishes it most markedly from the other programmes companies and from the BBC.\" Peter Salmon, of the BBC said: \"Granada made TV programmes in the north; for northerners, reflecting northern culture and attitudes.\"\\n\\nFrom the its launch in 1956 until 1968, when the pointed \\'G\\' logo was introduced, the channel used captions and animations featuring a thin arrow pointing upwards and Granada, in a stylised font, in boxes. The arrow pointed at the \"n\" in Granada, pointing north and sometimes animated revealing the slogan \\'From the North\\', before the Granada name. The pointed \\'G\\' was originally white on a grey background but after the introduction of colour, grey was replaced with blue, with the name in yellow.\\nA colour emblem was used from the 1970s until it was replaced by a series of idents to celebrate Granada\\'s 30th anniversary in 1986, when it was a computer animated pointed \"G\" against a graded background and a cake covered in candles in the pointed G shape. In 1987 Granada reverted to using a caption featuring a gold or chrome 3D pointed \\'G\\' on a graded blue background.\\nGranada used in-vision continuity featuring northern personalities giving messages. It was common for the logo to be seen for a few seconds after the continuity before the programme, and continuity was rarely given over the symbol.\\nIn 1989, Granada launched a look featuring a translucent pointed G which rotated into place in time to the music against a natural scene. When the first ITV generic look was launched, Granada refused to adopt it, because the Granada logo was incorrectly inserted into the \\'V\\' segment of the logo. The company used a version where its translucent logo was used at the beginning, before continuing with the generic ident and ending with the generic ITV logo.\\nIn 1990, Granada in the run-up to the 1990 franchise round, relaunched its on-screen branding to a blue stripe descending from the top of the screen, containing the pointed \\'G\\', against a plain white background accompanied by the same music as previously. Variations were seen from which the stripe formed from a falling feather or was backlit. In April 1992 the stripe descended, revealing a rainbow of colours before becoming the usual blue.\\nIn 1994 Granada introduced a series of films featuring flags with its logo against various scenes in the region, accompanied by the slogan \\'Setting the Standard\\'. These introduced local programming, Granada Reports, or promotions.\\nIn 1995 the stripe theme was modified; the pointed \\'G\\' was larger on the blue stripe against a computer generated multicoloured background and the \\'G\\' was created by filming a large perspex \\'G\\' with motion control photography. This ident was used, from a variety of angles, until November 1999, when additional idents based on surreal surroundings such as a fish blowing a bubble with a G inside, which floated to the surface, or a camera zoom into the eye of a housewife to reveal the G in her eye were introduced.\\nAll the idents were replaced in 1999 when Granada took the generic hearts idents. Granada kept the pointed G logo, made slightly thinner and placed in a box at the top of the screen. The dual branding of Granada and ITV lasted until 28 October 2002, when regional identities were dropped in favour of the new ITV1 channel brand. The celebrities ident package featured plain ITV1 idents for all national programmes, and Granada placed under the ITV1 logo for regional programmes. This practice continued until 2006, when no name was used, and Granada Productions was replaced with ITV Productions on programme end boards. The Granada logo continued on end boards until this date. The Granada name was used on announcements before local programming over a generic ITV1 ident until all non-news regional programming was scrapped.\\nOn 14 January 2013, the station\\'s on-air identity was changed to ITV, along with all other ITV plc-owned franchises.\\nDuring the early days, the pointed G logo was used on two other, subsidiary businesses. Firstly came the \\'Red Arrow Television Rental\\' chain. During the days when many families preferred to rent their TV sets to offset poor reliability and changing fashions, this company fared well alongside the established heavy hitters such as Radio Rentals. The company\\'s opening promotion was to give every new customer a small, Hiawatha style figurine to stand on top of their new TV set. Upon its success, the name was later changed to \\'Granada TV Rental\\'. Based on the results of this company, Granada dipped its toes into the office furniture rental business, with \\'Black Arrow\\'. This business was less successful.\\nOn Bridge Street in Manchester, the adjacent street to the Granada TV studios, stands a dry cleaning business called Granada Granada Dry Cleaners. Despite the company\\'s logo and shop facia signs aping (until early in 2014 when their signage was revamped) exactly the Granada Television logo typeface, Granada Dry Cleaners is a wholly independent, family-run business \\u2013 established in 1957 by Gerald and Ronnie Singer \\u2013 and has no connection whatsoever with Granada TV or it subsidiaries.\\n\\n\\n== Programmes ==\\n\\nIn 1958, Granada Television broadcast coverage of the Rochdale by-election, 1958 \\u2013 the first election to be covered on television in Britain. Granada\\'s coverage was broad in scope and it also broadcast two candidate debates. Over 50 years later, Granada Studios hosted the first General Election debate between the leaders of the three main political parties.\\nGranada\\'s boldness was seen in ambitious documentaries such as Seven Up! which premi\\xe8red in 1964. The programme was a social experiment which followed the lives of 14 British children aged seven. It tracked their lives at seven-year intervals to discover whether their hopes and aspirations had been achieved. The documentary was voted the greatest ever by esteemed film-makers and its latest instalment, 56 Up, premi\\xe8red in 2012. Seven Up was part of the World in Action documentary series between 1963 and 1998 which won awards but was controversial. It garnered a reputation for hard-hitting investigative journalism and its producer Gus Macdonald commented that the programme was \\'born brash\\' and Paul Greengrass stated that David Plowright told him, \"don\\'t forget, your job\\'s to make trouble.\" World in Action demonstrated hard-hitting investigative journalism and explored issues such as police corruption at the Metropolitan Police in 1985 and revealed the Royal Family\\'s tax loophole in 1991. The programme led a campaign to prove the innocence of the Birmingham Six in 1985 when researcher Chris Mullin questioned the convictions and by 1991 the men had been released.\\nThe classic northern working-class soap opera Coronation Street started a 13-week, two-episodes-a-week regional run on 9 December 1960. It is still produced at the rate of five peak-viewing episodes a week after 50 years, and is the longest-running soap opera in the world. The company produced gritty dramas such as A Family at War (1970\\u201372).\\nGranada produced The Stars Look Down (1975), Laurence Olivier Presents (1976\\u201378), Brideshead Revisited (1981), the multi-award-winning Disappearing World series (between 1969 and 1993) and, from 1984, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and The Jewel in the Crown for an international audience. These shows were sold overseas by Granada Television International.\\nAnother flagship programme, the long-running quiz show, University Challenge was originally aired between 1962 and 1987 and revived by the BBC in 1994 (produced by Granada). The company produced the Krypton Factor, between 1977 and 1995 (revived by ITV in 2009). One of Granada\\'s longest-running programmes, What The Papers Say, was broadcast by Granada in 1956, was taken over by the BBC in the early 1990s, and was shown by Channel Four. The programme introduced the idea of discussing what the newspapers were reporting, continued by Sunday Supplement and The Wright Stuff. In the 1970s, Granada produced situation comedies, often based around life in the north west including Nearest and Dearest, The Lovers and The Cuckoo Waltz followed by Brothers McGregor and Watching in the 1980s.\\nGranada drew on 1970s pop music with shows such as Lift Off with Ayshea and the Bay City Rollers show, Shang-a-lang. Granada\\'s So It Goes showcased the punk phenomenon, bringing the Sex Pistols and the Clash to our screens. The station also produced Marc, presented by glam rock star Marc Bolan. The show was in production when Bolan was killed in a car accident in 1977. Granada produced Allsorts from 1989 to 1995 for CITV, featuring Wayne Jackman, Andrew Wightman (who later produced Granada\\'s talent show Stars in Their Eyes), Virginia Radcliffe, Jane Cox and Julie Westwood.\\n\\n\\n== Personalities ==\\nGranada Television has introduced many broadcasters and personalities to British television and had a number of directors, producers and writers who have formed their own production companies. Some have been recognised for their achievements in British television with honours such as Knighthoods, while others achieved senior posts such as Director-General of the BBC. Jeremy Isaacs developed a significant portion of Granada\\'s factual programming, and the company produced a generation of major British TV \\'players\\' including Lord Birt, later Director-General of the BBC, and Lord Macdonald, his fellow World in Action producer. Many began work as researchers on the World in Action.\\nWriters, directors and producers\\nJohn Birt, Baron Birt started his career at Granada in 1966 as a researcher for World in Action before leaving in 1971. He became Director-General of the BBC from 1992 to 2000.\\nGus Macdonald was a researcher in 1967 and worked with John Birt before leaving nearly 20 years later in 1986.\\nAndy Harries was researcher before starting his television career on World in Action and worked in various roles until the 2000s.\\nNicola Schindler was a script-writer on Cracker in 1993 before forming the Red Production Company.\\nJeremy Isaacs joined Granada in 1968 where he supervised production of World in Action and What the Papers Say.\\nPaul Abbott is a former screenwriter who created State of Play and Shameless.\\nRussell T Davies collaborated with Paul Abbott as a writer in the 1990s.\\nPaul Greengrass was a director of current affairs program World in Action in the 1980s before becoming a film director.\\nKay Mellor worked with Paul Abbott on Children\\'s Ward and wrote other drama serials such as Strictly Confidential and Between the Sheets.\\nTom Hooper directed two episodes of Cold Feet and directed Prime Suspect before becoming a film director.\\nMichael Apted begun his television career and stayed for over twenty years. He devised the Up series documentary.\\nJack Rosenthal was a prolific playwright producing The Dustbinmen and The Lovers.\\nJim Allen, a prolific socialist playwright best known for his collaborations with Ken Loach. Contributed script to Coronation Street between 1965 until 1967.\\nPresenters\\nSir Michael Parkinson began his television career at Granada Television.\\nTony Wilson presented Granada Reports and music programmes which promoted Manchester music which gave him the nickname Mr Manchester.\\nGordon Burns joined in 1972 and presented Granada Reports, World in Action and the Krypton Factor.\\nRichard Madeley joined Granada in 1982 where he met Judy Finnigan who joined as a researcher in 1972.\\nSacha Baron Cohen had a chatshow, F2F on Granada Talk TV in 1996.\\nLucy Meacock is Granada news presenter since 1988 and occasional presenter for the ITV national news.\\n\\n\\n== Other ventures ==\\n\\n\\n=== Granada Studios Tour ===\\n\\nThe Granada Studios Tour opened in 1988 as an entertainment park on the Granada Studios Quay Street back lot, themed around television productions. The park featured a replica set of No. 10 Downing Street, and visitors were shown how television is produced. The main feature was the set of Coronation Street\\n\\n\\n=== G-Wizz ===\\nSeveral of Granada\\'s programmes administered their websites using G-Wizz, including This Morning, Coronation Street and Emmerdale. Its Flash-heavy pages were mostly unusable by subscribers, who were then still largely modem-based, and take-up was low. Less than a year after it opened, Granada closed G-Wizz in March 2001, after it had cost the company \\xa39 million. It combined the remainder of its online presence with fellow ITV company Carlton to launch itv.com.\\n\\n\\n=== Digital terrestrial platforms ===\\n\\n\\n==== ONdigital ====\\nFrom 1997 until 2002 Granada and Carlton invested and lost over \\xa31 billion with a joint venture into ONdigital, a pay-TV, digital terrestrial broadcaster. ONdigital was rebranded ITV Digital in summer 2001, but opposed by SMG plc, UTV, and Channel Television, who felt it would damage the ITV brand. ONdigital was expected to create a new revenue stream and be floated as a separate company but by March 1999 the service only had 110,000 subscribers, well below the 2 million Granada aimed for. Granada and Carlton persevered by rebranding the service ITV Digital but this too was not successful. Competition from Sky Digital launched in 1998 was too great and ITV Digital ceased broadcasting on 1 May 2002. This led to sweeping cuts in the organisation, including cutting budgets for flagship drama serials and productions and loss of jobs at the Manchester headquarters.\\n\\n\\n==== ITV Digital ====\\n\\nIn 1996 Granada joined BSkyB to form a joint venture, Granada Sky Broadcasting (GSB) providing content and new channels to the satellite platform. Granada launched a range of television channels broadcasting the Granada archive on the Sky satellite television platform and other digital platforms such as ITV Digital which closed in 2002 due to administration, NTL and Telewest (which merged to form Virgin Media). GSB operated as a joint venture until 2004 when ITV was formed. Consequently ITV purchased BSkyB\\'s 10% stake in the venture and launched ITV3 which replaced Granada Plus. GSB was renamed the ITV digital channels Ltd to reflect ITV plc control.\\n\\n\\n=== Additional channels ===\\n\\n\\n==== Granada Plus ====\\nGranada Plus was a general entertainment channel, a 50\\u201350 joint venture between Granada Television and British Sky Broadcasting, aimed at older audiences using archived material. The channel, launched as Granada Plus, was later known as G Plus and finally Plus. It broadcast until 1 November 2004, when ITV bought BSkyB\\'s stake in GSB, and closed the channel, replacing it with ITV3, and taking Plus\\' low EPG position on Sky Digital.\\n\\n\\n==== Granada Breeze ====\\nOriginally Granada Good Life, Granada Breeze was another GSB venture. It was a lifestyle channel aimed at women viewers and showed programmes on, cookery, health and US daytime television such as Judge Joe Brown. It provided programmes split into themed sections called Granada Talk Television, Granada Food and Wine, Granada Health and Beauty, Granada Television High Street and Granada Home and Garden. Most shows were presented from a large conservatory studio outside the Coronation Street studio which was later used for daytime ITV Play programming. Granada Breeze was scaled down in July 2001 before ceasing operation in March 2002 due to poor viewing figures.\\n\\n\\n==== Others ====\\nAnother channel, Wellbeing, a joint venture with Boots, modelled on Granada Breeze was broadcast from The Leeds Studios, although Granada made some programmes, closed in 2003.\\nA male oriented channel, Men and Motors, lasted longest of all the channels, and ran until 2010, when it was closed to make way for ITV HD. Most of its programmes were transferred to ITV4.\\nGranada Talk TV focused on chat shows and closed after less than a year on air.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Awards and accolades ===\\nGranada Television had a reputation for strong production values. In 1999, Granada Television made eight of ITV\\'s top-rated programmes and 30% of the UK\\'s top-rated programmes came from its studios and in 2005 supplied 63% of ITV original production. It was the only ITA broadcaster created in 1954 that survived into the 21st century, and flourished it emerged the dominant player in the ITV network by 2000.\\nIn the 19 BAFTA Awards for the Best Drama series awarded since 1992, Granada Television has won five in total, Cracker twice in 1994 and 1995, Cold Feet in 2002 and The Street in 2007 and 2008 \\u2013 more than any other production company.\\nCoronation Street became the longest running serial soap in 2010 when it celebrated its 50th anniversary and the ongoing Seven Up documentary series was voted the greatest documentary in a Channel 4 programme by film makers.\\n\\n\\n=== Criticism and controversy ===\\n\\nGranada has attracted controversy since its inception; the most serious were libel cases in the 1990s resulting in the cancellation of World in Action.\\n\\n\\n==== Criticisms of perceived Manchester-centric bias ====\\nIn three franchise rounds (1967, 1980, and 1991) three groups (Palatine Television, Merseyvision, and Mersey Television, wherein the latter two were unconnected) each made audacious bids to rid Granada of its franchise, but were unsuccessful, given that Granada was well respected (second only to the BBC). The opponents claimed to the regulatory bodies that existed at the time (the ITA in 1967, the IBA in 1981, and the ITC in 1991) in these successive franchise rounds that Granada was too Manchester-centred at the expense of the Liverpool area and need to cater for the whole of North West England. They were supported by the fact that Granada Television was frequently referred to as \"Granada Manchester\" (not \"Granada North West\"), as most productions were made in Manchester and in 2005 Granada and the Manchester City Council held a celebration recognising Granada\\'s 50th anniversary cementing this perception further. In 1993, Brian Sedgemore MP, complained that promises Granada made during the 1991 franchise round to open offices in Chester, Lancaster and Blackburn were not fulfilled, but David Liddiment at Granada did not believe this assertion to be true.\\nGranada had increased investment in Liverpool moving its regional news service to the Albert Dock complex in 1986, before moving back to Quay Street sometime in the early 2000s.\\nThe ITV network based its daytime show This Morning at Liverpool\\'s Albert Dock for many years before it moved to the London Studios in 1996, as it was difficult to get celebrity guests to travel from London to Liverpool.\\n\\n\\n==== Criticisms and controversies over World in Action and Tonight ====\\nGranada\\'s bold, hard-hitting television and documentaries have resulted in legal cases. David Plowright told junior researcher, Paul Greengrass, that Granada\\'s role was to make trouble. World in Action was hard-hitting but resulted in expensive, libel trials when wrong accusations were made in the 1990s.\\nIn 1998 Granada paid \\xa32 million in two cases, to three Metropolitan Police officers who were wrongly accused of covering up a murder and Marks and Spencer for alleging M&S knew one of its suppliers was using child labour. World in Action was replaced by the Tonight programme in 1998 but it too was criticised, but this time, for dumbing down as the Tonight programme is markedly less hard-hitting.\\nNevertheless, Tonight had occasionally stirred controversy over libelous cases like its predecessor. An example is the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson (a Tonight special). Its airing resulted in the threat of legal action by Michael Jackson. The documentary gained a large audience, 15 million in the United Kingdom, and newspapers depicted Jackson in a negative light following the documentary.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nMedia in Manchester\\nITV Studios \\u2013 Granada Television\\'s production arm\\nGranada plc \\u2013 Granada Television\\'s parent company\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nCitations\\n\\nBibliography\\nFinch, John (2003).

Depending on the state, state highway may be used for one meaning and state road or state route for the other.\\nIn some countries such as New Zealand, the word \"state\" is used in its sense of a nation. By this meaning a state highway is a road maintained and numbered by the national government rather than local authorities.\\n\\n\\n== National usage ==\\n\\n\\n=== Australia ===\\n\\nAustralia\\'s State Route system covers urban and inter-regional routes that are not included in the National Route or the National Highway systems. These routes are marked with a blue shield. Sometimes a state route may be formed when a former national route is decommissioned.\\nMost states and territories have introduced an alphanumeric route numbering system, either completely or partially replacing the previous systems.\\n\\n\\n=== Brazil ===\\nBrazil is another country that is divided into States and has state highways.\\n\\n\\n=== Canada ===\\n\\nCanada is divided into provinces and as such has Provincial Highways.\\n\\n\\n=== Italy ===\\n\\nItaly\\'s Strade Statali extend for some 18,000 km, overseen by the Azienda Nazionale Autonoma delle Strade (ANAS) founded in 1946, replacing the A.A.S.S. (Azienda Autonoma delle Strade Statali) of 1928.\\n\\n\\n=== India ===\\n\\nIn India, State Highways refer to the numbered highways which are laid and maintained by state governments.\\n\\n\\n=== Mexico ===\\nMexico\\'s State Highway System is a system of urban and state routes constructed and maintained by each Mexican state. The main purpose of the state networks is to serve as a feeder system to the federal highway system. All states except the Federal District operate a road network. Each state marks these routes with a white shield containing the abbreviated name of the state plus the route number.\\n\\n\\n=== New Zealand ===\\n\\nNew Zealand state highways are national highways \\u2013 the word \"state\" in this sense means \"government\" or \"public\" (as in state housing and state schools), not a division of a country.\\nNew Zealand\\'s state highway system is a nationwide network of roads covering the North Island and the South Island. As of 2006, just under 100 roads have a \"State Highway\" designation. The New Zealand Transport Agency administers them. The speed limit for most state highways is 100 km/h, with reductions when one passes through a densely populated area.\\nThe highways in New Zealand were originally designated on a two-tier system, national (SH 1\\u20138) and provincial, with national highways having a higher standard and funding priorities. Now all of them are state highways, and the network consists of SH 1 running the length of both main islands, SH 2\\u20135 and 10\\u201358 in the North Island, and SH 6\\u20138 and 60\\u201399 in the South Island. National and provincial highways are numbered approximately north to south. State Highway 1 runs the length of both islands.\\n\\n\\n=== United States ===\\nSee also Numbered highways in the United States#State highways and other similar systems\\n\\nState highways are generally a mixture of primary and secondary roads, although some are freeways (for example, State Route 99 in California, which links many of the cities of the Central Valley, Route 128 in Massachusetts, Ronald Reagan/Cross County Highway (State Route 126) in Cincinnati, or parts of Route 101 in New Hampshire). Each state has its own system for numbering and its own marker. The default marker is a white circle containing a black sans serif number (often inscribed in a black square or slightly rounded square), according to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). However each state is free to choose a different marker, and most states have. States may choose a design theme relevant to its state to distinguish state route markers from interstate, county, or municipal route markers.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n Roads portal\\nList of longest state highways in the United States\\nList of numbered highways in the United States\\nInterstate Highway System, U.S. Highway System\\nMissouri supplemental route\\nCounty highway\\nHighways in Australia\\nNumbered street\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n Media related to State highway at Wikimedia Commons', u'Cassiar Gold Rush': u'The Cassiar Country, also referred to simply as the Cassiar, is one of the historical geographic regions of the Canadian province of British Columbia. The Cassiar is located in the northwest portion of British Columbia, just to the northeast of the Stikine Country, while to the south is the Omineca Country.\\n\\n\\n== Collins Telegraph Line ==\\n\\nIn the early 1860s, Perry Collins obtained financing from Western Union Telegraph to build a telegraph line from San Francisco through British Columbia and Alaska and across the Bering Strait to Russia and ultimately Europe.\\nThe line was begun in 1865 at New Westminster, and continued as far as the Skeena River in 1866, but then the project was abandoned as the transatlantic line was built first, making the Collins line redundant. Despite the fact that the Collins line would not be completed, surveyors had created a primitive route from Quesnel to the newly established settlement of Telegraph Creek, thus opening up the northern districts of British Columbia for determined and hardy travelers.\\n\\n\\n== Cassiar Gold Rush ==\\nIn the 1870s a gold rush occurred in the region, based at McDame Creek and at Thibert Creek, a tributary of Dease Creek. In 1874, more than a million dollars\\' worth of gold was taken from the region and in 1877, one prospector found the largest nugget ever recorded in British Columbia: a 72 ounce gold nugget, mined from McDame Creek.\\n\\nMuch as the Stikine Country had been affected by the rush on the Stikine River, the Cassiar Gold Rush caused the government to show an interest in the area and John R Adams was appointed as government agent for the Cassiar region in 1873, and was followed by Judge J.H. Sullivan who became the region\\'s gold commissioner. Laketon, also known as Dease Town became the unofficial capital of the Cassiar and at the height of the rush it had five stores, four hotels, two cafes and its own newspaper. Other gold rush towns were Porter Landing and Defot. However by the 1880s most of the gold had been recovered and nearly all of the miners left the area, while only few merchants and Chinese miners remained behind. The region was also affected by the Klondike Gold Rush when in 1897-1898, 5000 miners went to the Yukon via the all Canadian route, up the Stikine River to Telegraph Creek and overland to the Teslin River.\\n\\n\\n== Later years ==\\nAfter the excitement of the gold rushes, the Cassiar was nearly forgotten until the early 1940s when the American military built the Alaska Highway from Dawson Creek, British Columbia to Fairbanks, Alaska, thus further opening up the area and providing ease of transportation like never before. Small companies began gold mining with heavy equipment. Then, most notably, the early 1950s brought the Cassiar Asbestos Mine, which operated from 1953 until 1992 and produced the company town of Cassiar.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCassiar Mountains\\nStewart-Cassiar Highway\\nCassiar (electoral district)\\nNellie Cashman \"Angel of the Cassiar\"\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nCassiar A Jewel in the Wilderness Suzanne Leblanc ISBN 0-920576-99-0\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nCassiar\\u2026 do you remember?', u'Columbia Gorge': u'The Columbia River Gorge is a canyon of the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Up to 4,000 feet (1,200 m) deep, the canyon stretches for over 80 miles (130 km) as the river winds westward through the Cascade Range forming the boundary between the State of Washington to the north and Oregon to the south. Extending roughly from the confluence of the Columbia with the Deschutes River down to eastern reaches of the Portland metropolitan area, the water gap furnishes the only navigable route through the Cascades and the only water connection between the Columbia River Plateau and the Pacific Ocean.\\nThe gorge holds federally protected status as a National Scenic Area called the Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area and is managed by the Columbia River Gorge Commission and the US Forest Service. The gorge is a popular recreational destination.\\n\\n\\n== Description ==\\nThe Columbia River cuts the only sea-level passageway through the Cascade Mountain Range here between the Deschutes River and the Sandy River, also marking the state lines between Oregon and Washington. The wide range of elevation and precipitation makes the Columbia River Gorge an extremely diverse and dynamic place. Ranging from 4,000 feet (1,200 m) to sea level, and transitioning from 100 inches (2,500 mm) of precipitation to only 10 inches (250 mm) in 80 miles (130 km), the Gorge creates a diverse collection of ecosystems from the temperate rain forest on the western end\\u2014with an average annual precipitation of 75 to 100 inches (1,900 to 2,500 mm)\\u2014to the eastern grasslands with average annual precipitation between 10 and 15 inches (250 and 380 mm), to a transitional dry woodland between Hood River and The Dalles. Isolated micro-habitats have allowed for many species of endemic plants and animals to prosper, including at least 13 endemic wildflowers.\\nThe Gorge transitions between temperate rainforest to dry grasslands in only 80 miles, hosting a dramatic change in scenery while driving down I-84. In the western, temperate rainforest areas, forests are marked by bigleaf maples, Douglas Fir, and Western hemlock, all covered in epiphytes. In the transition zone (between Hood River and The Dalles), vegetation turns to Oregon white oak, Ponderosa pine, and cottonwood. At the eastern end, the forests make way for expansive grasslands, with occasional pockets of lodgepole pine and Ponderosa pine.\\nAtmospheric pressure differentials east and west of the Cascades create a wind tunnel effect in the deep cut of the gorge, generating 35 mph (56 km/h) winds that make it a popular windsurfing and kitesurfing location.\\nThe Gorge is a popular destination for hiking, biking, sight-seeing, fishing, and watersports. The area is known for its high concentration of waterfalls, with over 90 on the Oregon side of the Gorge alone. Many are along the Historic Columbia River Highway, including the notable 620-foot (190 m)-high Multnomah Falls.\\nTrails and day use sites are maintained by the Forest Service and many Oregon and Washington state parks.\\n\\n\\n== Geology ==\\nThe Columbia River Gorge began forming as far back as the Miocene, (roughly 17 to 12 million years ago), and continued to take shape through the Pleistocene, (2 million to 700,000 years ago). During this period the Cascades Range was forming, which slowly moved the Columbia River\\'s delta about 100 miles (160 km) north to its current location.\\nAlthough the river slowly eroded the land over this period of time, the most drastic changes took place at the end of the last Ice Age when the Missoula Floods cut the steep, dramatic walls that exist today, flooding the river as high up as Crown Point. This quick erosion left many layers of volcanic rock exposed.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe gorge has supported human habitation for over 13,000 years. Evidence of the Folsom and Marmes people, who crossed the Bering land bridge from Asia, were found in archaeological digs. Excavations near Celilo Falls, a few miles east of The Dalles, show humans have occupied this salmon-fishing site for more than 10,000 years.\\nThe gorge has provided a transportation corridor for thousands of years. Native Americans would travel through the Gorge to trade at Celilo Falls, both along the river and over Lolo Pass on the north side of Mount Hood. In 1805, the route was used by the Lewis and Clark Expedition to reach the Pacific. Early European and American settlers subsequently established steamboat lines and railroads through the gorge. Today, the BNSF Railway runs freights along the Washington side of the river, while its rival, the Union Pacific Railroad, runs freights along the Oregon shore. Until 1997, Amtrak\\'s Pioneer also used the Union Pacific tracks. The Portland segment of the Empire Builder uses the BNSF tracks that pass through the gorge.\\nThe Columbia River Highway, built in the early 20th century, was the first major paved highway in the Pacific Northwest. Shipping was greatly simplified after Bonneville Dam and The Dalles Dam submerged the gorge\\'s major rapids such as Celilo Falls, a major salmon fishing site for local Native Americans until the site\\'s submergence in 1957.\\nIn November 1986, Congress made it the second U.S. National Scenic Area and established the Columbia River Gorge Commission as part of an interstate compact. In 2004, the gorge became the namesake of the Columbia Gorge American Viticultural Area, a 4,432-acre (1,794 ha) area located on both sides of the river.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBarlow Road, the first wagon-compatible pioneer road to provide a safer alternative to traveling through the gorge\\nCascades Rapids\\nColumbia Gorge casino, a proposed off-reservation casino in Cascade Locks\\nWahclella Falls\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nU.S. Forest Service - Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area\\nColumbia River Gorge Commission\\nColumbia Gorge Magazine\\nAbbott, Carl. \"Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area\".

A bank may accumulate a large portfolio of debts or other financial instruments which unexpectedly increase in risk, making it difficult for the bank to raise capital, for example through sales of bonds. In these circumstances, the bank may wish to segregate its \"good\" assets from its \"bad\" assets through the creation of a bad bank. The goal of the segregation is to allow investors to assess the bank\\'s financial health with greater certainty.\\nIn addition to segregating or removing the bad assets from the parent bank\\'s balance sheet, a bad bank structure permits more specialized management. The good bank can focus on its core business of lending, and the bad bank can specialize in maximizing value from the high risk assets.\\nSuch institutions have been created to address challenges arising during an economic credit crunch to allow private banks to take problem assets off their books. The financial crisis of 2007\\u20132010 resulted in bad banks being set up in several countries. For example, a bad bank was suggested as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to help address the subprime mortgage crisis in the US. In the Republic of Ireland, a bad bank, the National Asset Management Agency was established in 2009, in response to the financial crisis in that country.\\n\\n\\n== Models ==\\nIn a 2009 report, McKinsey & Company identified four basic models for bad banks. In an on-balance-sheet guarantee, the bank uses some mechanism (typically a government guarantee) to protect part of its portfolio against losses. While simple to implement, this situation is difficult for investors to assess. In an internal restructuring, the bank creates a separate unit to hold the bad assets. This solution is more transparent, but doesn\\'t isolate the bank from risk. In a Special-purpose entity (SPE), the bank transfers its bad assets to another organization, typically government backed. This solution requires significant government participation. Finally, in a bad bank spinoff, the bank creates a new, independent bank to hold the bad assets. This completely isolates the original bank from the risky assets.\\n\\n\\n== Examples ==\\n\\n\\n=== Mellon Bank (1988) ===\\nThe first bank to use the bad bank strategy was Mellon Bank, which created a bad bank entity in 1988 to hold $1.4 billion of bad loans. Initially, the Federal Reserve was reluctant to issue a charter to the new bank, Grant Street National Bank, but Mellon\\'s CEO, Frank Cahouet, persisted and the regulators eventually agreed.\\nA dumping ground for non-performing energy and real estate loans, Grant Street was spun off with its own five-member board of directors and about $130 million in Mellon capital; it was named for a main street in Pittsburgh which was home to Mellon Financial headquarters. It took no public deposits. Mellon shareholders were issued shares in both the good and bad banks on a one-for-one basis, as a dividend. After the Grant Street National Bank had fulfilled its purpose, issuing preferred shares and equity purchase contracts to finance the purchase of $1 billion in Mellon\\'s bad loans at 57% of face value, then collecting what it could on the individual loans, it was liquidated and its employees quietly returned to Mellon Bank.\\nGrant Street\\'s early investors made handsome profits; the bank was dissolved in 1995 after repaying all bondholders and meeting its objectives.\\n\\n\\n=== Swedish banking crisis of 1992 ===\\nThe Swedish banking crisis of 1992 was the direct result of a combination of over speculation in property assets and the exchange rate of the Swedish krona. By 1992 three of the four major banks were insolvent.\\nThe Swedish authorities engaged McKinsey & Company to help design a solution, and chose to establish two bad banks, Retriva and Securum. Retriva took over all the nonperforming loans from Gota Bank (sv) and Securum took over the non-performing loans from Nordbanken, with the good bank operations continuing as Nordea. The government retained a significant equity stake in Nordea. Lars Thunell was appointed to lead Securum, supported by Anders Nyr\\xe9n and Jan Kvarnstr\\xf6m to manage its toxic book, at the time valued at sek 51 billion.\\nThe performance of Securum has been analysed by many, such as Claes Bergstr\\xf6m. While the figures are debated, depending on initial costs and the time frame the cost was no more than 2% of GDP (an extremely good result) and eventually both bad banks made a positive return. Nordea has been considered one of the strongest and best performing banks in Europe.\\nInternational commentators such as Brad DeLong and Paul Krugman have suggested the Swedish bad banking model be adopted internationally.\\n\\n\\n=== Finland ===\\nThe Finnish banking crisis of the 1990s caused the collapse of two major banks, the S\\xe4\\xe4st\\xf6pankki group/SKOP and STS Bank. The government founded a bad bank (\"property management company\"), OHY Arsenal, which took over the bad debt.\\n\\n\\n=== Belgium ===\\nThe 2008\\u201309 Belgian financial crisis is a major financial crisis that hit Belgium from mid-2008 onwards. Two of the country\\'s largest banks \\u2013 Fortis and Dexia \\u2013 started to face severe problems, exacerbated by the financial problems hitting other banks around the world. The value of their stocks plunged. The government managed the situation by bailouts, selling off or nationalizing banks, providing bank guarantees and extending the deposit insurance. Eventually Fortis was split into two parts. The Dutch part was nationalized, while the Belgian part was sold to the French bank BNP Paribas. Dexia group was dismantled, Dexia Bank Belgium was nationalized.\\n\\n\\n=== US sub-prime mortgage collapse of 2008 ===\\nIn early 2009, Citigroup dumped more than $700 billion worth of impaired assets into bad bank Citi Holdings. By 2012, the Citi Holdings bad bank represented 9% of the total Citigroup balance sheet.\\nIn March 2011, Bank of America segregated almost half its 13.9 million mortgages into a bad bank composed of risky and worst-performing \\u201clegacy\\u201d loans.\\n\\n\\n=== Baltic crisis of 2008-2011 ===\\nEstonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the European Union in 2004, attracting an influx of foreign investment and launching a real estate bubble which burst during the financial crisis of 2007\\u201308, leaving the countries saddled with foreign debt. Riga-based Parex Bank, the largest Latvian-owned bank, was vulnerable as it held large sums from foreign depositors (which began withdrawing assets around the time of Lehman Brothers September 2008 collapse) and was heavily exposed to real estate loans. Latvia\\'s government took a controlling interest in Parex in November 2008, spinning off Citadele banka as a good bank in August 2010. The bad assets were left behind, effectively creating a bad bank with the original Parex Banka name and no retail depositors. The Parex \"bad bank,\" its core retail functions stripped out by the 2010 split, gave up its banking licence in 2012 to become professional distressed asset management company Reverta.\\nWhile the crisis was focused in the markets of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, it involved Swedish banks, so Sweden was also exposed. The Baltic Crisis was partly initiated by the global credit crunch, but it revealed questionable lending practices of all major Swedish banks. Swedbank was particularly exposed, given its 50% share of market and well over sek150 million of impaired loans. With the support of the Swedish authorities the new CEO of Swedbank, Michael Wolf, engaged bad bank specialist Kvanrnstrom, European Resolution Capital and Justin Jenk who lead the formation and management of Swedbank\\u2019s bad banking operations (Financial Resolution & Recovery and Ektornet).This work was part of wider revolutionary change at Swedbank. This bad bank\\u2019s creation was covered in depth and published in a book by Birgitta Forsberg. The steps by management and this team were instrumental in rescuing Swedbank and stabilizing the region\\u2019s economy. Today, Swedbank is considered one of Europe\\u2019s stronger and better performing banks.\\n\\n\\n=== United Kingdom ===\\nIn 2010 the UK government established UK Asset Resolution, a state owned limited company to manage the assets of the two bankrupt nationalised mortgage lenders Bradford & Bingley and Northern Rock (Asset Management). This bad bank manages a total mortgage book of \\xa362.3bn (as at 30 September 2013)\\nIn 2013, the Royal Bank of Scotland transferred \\xa338.3bn of its worst loans to an internal bad bank. In 2014, Barclays Bank dumped the bulk of its commodities operation and fixed income business into an internal \"bad bank\" as part of a restructuring in which it greatly curtailed its investment banking activities.\\n\\n\\n=== Germany ===\\nGermany has several bad banks dating as far back as the 1980s, Bankaktiengesellschaft (BAG), owned by the Federal Association of German \\'Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken\\' Co-operative Banks, Bankgesellschaft Berlin, Erste Abwickelungsanstalt and FMS Wertemanagement. The Erste Abwickelungsanstalt and the FMS Wertmanagement together hold 190 Bn \\u20ac and 170 Bn \\u20ac respectively from the failed WestLB and Hypo Real Estate.\\n\\n\\n=== Spain (2012) ===\\nIn 2012 the Spanish government granted powers to the Fund for orderly restructuring of the bank sector (FROB) to force banks to pass toxic assets to a financial institution whose role is to remove risky assets from banks balance sheets and to sell off the assets at a profit over a 15 year period. The SAREB (Restructured Banks Asset Management Company) has assets of close to \\u20ac62Bn on its balance sheet.\\n\\n\\n=== Portugal (2014) ===\\nOn 3 August 2014, Banco de Portugal, Portugal\\'s central bank announced a \\u20ac 4.4 billion bailout of BES that heralded the end of BES as a private bank. It will be funded by the European Stability Mechanism. The bank will be split into a healthy bank, Novo Bank, while the toxic assests remain in the existing bank.\\n\\n\\n== Some major conclusions from the experiences in Sweden ==\\nBy separating the non-performing loans from the banks, it was possible to start the process of focusing the banks back to lending. Trying to work out all the non-performing loans inside the bank only prolonged the healing process in the organisation and reduced the ability of the bank to lend more to the public and businesses.\\nRepairing the balance sheet of the banks is only one important element to get the banks back to normal lending activities. The other major element is organisational processes.\\nThe organisational requirements are very different in a bad bank than in a normal bank. A good bank is a \\'process\\' organisation while a bad bank is a \\'project\\' organisation. The skill set and the emphasis on type of skills are different in a restructuring and winding up situation than in a lending situation.\\nThe first year of the bad bank determines its success. The challenge is the large number of non-performing loans in a wide variety of situations with regards to geographical location, type of industry, size and type of problem. If the bad bank does not quickly get control of the loans, a lot of value is lost and the capital requirements of the bad bank can change dramatically. To be successful, a well-defined process on how to handle the different loans has to be established. This process has to be followed and managed with force and speed in the organisation. If not, the bad bank will easily end up in chaos.\\nWhen a bad bank has gone through its credit work-out process, the remains of the bad bank is often asset ownership. Therefore the bad bank in its life span changes dramatically from being at the outset basically a bank with a large number of loans to later in life a large asset-owning company. A common mistake is to think of this last phase of the bad bank as a kind of investment company. An investment company has very well defined objectives regarding what type of assets they want to acquire. They choose the assets they want to acquire. A bad bank gets all the assets that are left after the credit work-out process.\\nA lifetime of 10\\u201315 years is too long for planning purposes. The world changes substantially in such a long life span. Most banking crises are over in a 5\\u20136 year period. A 5\\u20136 year time span is the logical time to use for planning purposes and the time line to use for winding down a bad bank.\\nAll three bad bank structures have been deemed text book examples of success. They resolved the toxic loans and made positive returns to the relevant stakeholders. This body of work has been referenced by governments and authorities around the world as best practice and some of its lessons applied (most recently in Ireland, Spain, Cyprus and Slovenia).\\n\\n\\n== Criticism ==\\nCritics of bad banks argue that the prospect that the state will take over non-performing loans encourages banks to take undue risks, which they otherwise would not, i.e. a moral hazard in risk-taking. Another criticism is that the option of handing the loan over to the bad bank becomes essentially a subsidy on corporate bankruptcy. Instead of developing a company that is temporarily unable to pay, the bondholder is given an incentive to sue for bankruptcy immediately, which makes it eligible for sale to a bad bank. Thus, it can become a subsidy for banks on the expense of small businesses.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBridge bank\\nResolution Trust Corporation\\nTroubled Asset Relief Program\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nComparison of Different Bad Bank Models by U Neyer and Thomas Vieten\\nThe German government\\'s \"bad bank\" model, a Bundesbank article', u'Public limited company': u'A public limited company (legally abbreviated to PLC) is a type of public company (publicly held company) under United Kingdom company law, some Commonwealth jurisdictions, and the Republic of Ireland. It is a limited (liability) company whose shares may be freely sold and traded to the public (although a plc may also be privately held, often by another plc), with a minimum share capital of \\xa350,000 and the letters PLC after its name. Similar companies in the United States are called publicly traded companies.\\nA PLC can be either an unlisted or listed company on the stock exchanges. In the United Kingdom, a public limited company usually must include the words \"public limited company\" or the abbreviation \"PLC\" or \"plc\" at the end and as part of the legal company name. Welsh companies may instead choose to end their names with ccc, an abbreviation for cwmni cyfyngedig cyhoeddus. However, some public limited companies (mostly nationalised concerns) incorporated under special legislation are exempted from bearing any of the identifying suffixes.\\nThe term \"public limited company\" and the \"PLC\"/\"plc\" suffix were introduced in 1974; prior to this, all limited companies bore the suffix \"Limited\" (\"Ltd\"), which is still used by private limited companies.\\n\\n\\n== Registration ==\\nWhen a new company incorporates in England and Wales or in Scotland, it must register with Companies House, an executive agency of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. In Northern Ireland, although prior to October 2009, companies in that jurisdiction were registered with the Northern Ireland Executive\\'s Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, companies registrations are now handled by the Companies House like the rest of the United Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n== Company directors ==\\nFormation of a public limited company requires a minimum of two directors (differing from country to country: in India three directors are required). In general terms anyone can be a company director, provided they are not disqualified on one of the following grounds:\\nin the case of PLCs or their subsidiaries, the person is over 70 years of age or reaches 70 years of age while in office, unless they are appointed or re-appointed by resolution of the company in general meeting of which special notice has been given.\\nthe person is an undischarged bankrupt, subject to a Bankruptcy Restrictions Order (BRO) or Bankruptcy Restrictions Undertaking (BRU) or otherwise disqualified by a Court from holding a directorship, unless given leave to act in respect of a particular company or companies.\\nin England and Wales (as of October 2008; Companies Act 2006) and in Scotland (Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991), the male/female is under 16 years old.\\nSome people who are not British or European Union citizens are restricted as to what work they may do while in the UK, which may exclude them from being a director.\\n\\n\\n== Share capital ==\\nThe members must agree to take some, or all, of the shares when the company is registered. The memorandum of association must show the names of the people who have agreed to take shares and the number of shares each will take. These people are called the subscribers.\\nThere is a minimum share capital for public limited companies: Before it can start business, it must have allotted shares to the value of at least \\xa350,000. A quarter of them, \\xa312,500, must be paid up. Each allotted share must be paid up to at least one quarter of its nominal value together with the whole of any premium.\\nA company can increase its authorised share capital by passing an ordinary resolution (unless its articles of association require a special or extraordinary resolution). A copy of the resolution \\u2013 and notice of the increase on Form 123 \\u2013 must reach Companies House within 15 days of being passed. No fee is payable to Companies House.\\nA company can decrease its authorised share capital by passing an ordinary resolution to cancel shares which have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person. Notice of the cancellation, on Form 122, must reach Companies House within one month. No fee is payable to Companies House.\\n\\n\\n=== Share types ===\\nA company may have as many different types of shares as it wishes, all with different conditions attached to them. Generally share types are divided into the following categories:\\nBearer shares \\u2013 Are a legal instrument denoting company ownership, and are usually in the form of share warrants. A share warrant is a document which states that the bearer of the warrant is entitled to the shares stated in it. If authorised by its articles, a company may convert any fully paid shares to \"share warrants\". These warrants are easily transferable without any need for a transfer document; that is, they can simply be passed from hand to hand. When share warrants are issued, the company must strike out the name of the shareholder from its register of members and state the date of issue of the warrant and the number of shares to which it relates. Subject to the articles, a share warrant can be surrendered for cancellation. If so, the holder is entitled to be re-entered into the register of members. Vouchers are usually issued with the share warrants in order that any dividends may be claimed. [This description of \"share warrants\" might only be applicable to the UK, because it seems to be at odds with practices in Australia and the USA.]\\nCumulative preference \\u2013 These shares carry a right that, if the dividend cannot be paid in one year, it will be carried forward to successive years.\\nOrdinary \\u2013 As the name suggests these are the ordinary shares of the company with no special rights or restrictions. They may be divided into classes of different value.\\nPreference \\u2013 These shares normally carry a right that any annual dividends available for distribution will be paid preferentially on these shares before other classes.\\nRedeemable \\u2013 These shares are issued with an agreement that the company will buy them back at the option of the company or the shareholder after a certain period, or on a fixed date. A company cannot have redeemable shares only.\\nA plc has access to capital markets and can offer its shares for sale to the public through a recognised stock exchange. It can also issue advertisements offering any of its securities for sale to the public. In contrast, a private company may not offer to the public any shares in itself.\\n\\n\\n=== Company formation ===\\nMost companies are now formed electronically via company formation agents.\\n\\n\\n==== Paper process ====\\nThe following documents, together with the registration fee are sent to the Registrar of Companies:\\nMemorandum of Association \\nThis sets out the company name, the registered office address and the company objects. The object of a company may simply be to carry on business as a general commercial company. The company\\'s memorandum delivered to the Registrar must be signed by each subscriber in front of a witness who must attest the signature. It is often referred to as the \\'charter of a company\\' or \\'constitution of the company\\'. The signatories to the Memorandum of Association are deemed to be the first Directors of the company. The Memorandum defines the relation of members with the rest of the world.\\nArticles of Association \\nThis is the document which sets out the rules for the running of the company\\'s internal affairs. The company\\'s articles delivered to the Registrar must be signed by each subscriber in front of a witness who must attest the signature. The Articles define the inter-management, inter-member and inter-employee relationship.\\nForm 1 \\nThis gives details of the first director(s), secretary and the intended address of the registered office. As well as their names and addresses, the company\\'s directors must give their date of birth, occupation and details of other directorships they have held within the last five years. Each officer appointed and each subscriber (or their agent) must sign and date the form.\\nForm 12 \\nThis is a statutory declaration of compliance with all the legal requirements relating to the incorporation of a company. It must be signed by a solicitor who is forming the company, or by one of the people named as a director or company secretary on Form 10. It must be signed in the presence of a commissioner for oaths, a notary public, a justice of the peace or a solicitor. There is usually a \\xa35 fee payable to the person that witnesses the statuary declaration.\\n\\n\\n==== Electronic process ====\\n\\nThe key difference with the paper process is that there is no Form 12 and requirement for a statutory declaration. This significantly speeds the process and Companies House\\'s record for an Electronic Company formation is 23 minutes.\\nBecause the electronic process requires compatible software that works with Companies House eFiling service, companies are usually formed through a Company Formation Agent.\\n\\n\\n=== Annual returns ===\\nEvery company must deliver an annual return to Companies House at least once every twelve months. It has 28 days from the date to which the return is made up to do this. Failure to file a return is a criminal offence, for which the officers of the company may be fined.\\nThere is an annual document-processing fee of \\xa330 (or \\xa315 for users of the Electronic Filing or WebFilings services), which must be sent to Companies House with the annual return.\\n\\n\\n== Conversion ==\\n\\n\\n=== Conversion of a private limited company to a public limited company ===\\nBoth a private company limited by shares and an unlimited company with a share capital may re-register as a plc, but a company without a share capital cannot do so.\\nA private company must pass a special resolution that it be so re-registered and deliver a copy of the resolution together with an application form to the Registrar. The resolution must also:\\nalter the company\\'s memorandum so that it states that the company is to be a public limited company,\\nincrease its share capital to the statutory minimum of \\xa350,000,\\nmake any other alterations to the memorandum so that it conforms to that required for a public limited company,\\nmake any required alterations to the articles of association of the company.\\nIf it does not already have sufficient share capital, the company must issue \\xa350,000 in shares a minimum of 25% part paid.\\n\\n\\n=== Conversion of a public limited company to a private limited company ===\\nIn some jurisdictions a public limited company may re-register as a private limited company or private unlimited company at any time with few formalities.\\nA court may also order a public company to re-register as private on approving a \\'minute of reduction\\' of share capital which results in the issued share capital falling below the statutory minimum. In such a case the court will also specify alterations to the company\\'s memorandum and articles. A special resolution to re-register is not required.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nEuropean Company Statute\\nLimited liability partnership\\nPrivate limited company\\nPublic company\\nS.A.

Schools whose names are italicized are no longer in Division I, and can no longer be included in the tournament.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nNIT bids by school\\nNIT championships and semifinal appearances', u'Starting pitcher': u'In baseball or softball, a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team. A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent\\'s first batter of a game. A pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher. Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game, although whether they do can depend on many factors, including effectiveness, stamina, health, and strategic reasons.\\nA starting pitcher in professional baseball usually rests three or four days after pitching a game before pitching another. Therefore, most professional baseball teams have four or five starting pitchers on their rosters. These pitchers, and the sequence in which they pitch, is known as the rotation. In modern baseball, a five-man rotation is most common.\\n\\n\\n== Workload ==\\nUnder ideal circumstances, a manager of a baseball team would prefer a starting pitcher to pitch as many innings as possible in a game. Most regular starting pitchers pitch for at least five innings on a regular basis, and if a pitcher is unable to do so, there is a high probability that he will, in the future, be relegated to duty in the bullpen. In modern baseball, a starting pitcher is rarely expected to pitch for more than seven or eight innings, at which point, responsibility for the game is passed to relief pitchers, including specialist pitchers such as setup pitchers and closers.\\nOften, a starting pitcher is subject to a pitch count, meaning the manager will remove him from the game once he has thrown a specific number of pitches. The most common pitch count for a modern pitcher is in the neighborhood of 100, and it is now rare for a starting pitcher to throw more than 125 pitches in a game. Pitch count limits are especially common for starting pitchers who are recovering from injury.\\nIn the early decades of baseball, it was not uncommon for a starting pitcher to pitch three hundred innings or more, over the course of a season. In addition, there are accounts of starting pitchers pitching on consecutive days, or even in both games of a doubleheader. It is believed that these feats were only possible because pitchers in the early years of the game, unlike modern starters, rarely threw the ball with maximum effort.\\nA starting pitcher who can be counted on to consistently throw many innings is known as a workhorse. An example of a modern day workhorse pitcher is Roy Halladay, who was the active leader in both complete games thrown and shutouts before his retirement in 2013.\\n\\n\\n== Statistics ==\\nA starting pitcher must complete five innings of work in order to qualify for a \"win\" in a game he starts. Under NCAA baseball rules, which govern intercollegiate baseball, a starting pitcher who pitches fewer than five innings can still earn a win if he pitches for a certain amount of time that is determined before the start of the game. It is possible to be credited with a loss despite pitching fewer than five innings. A starter who works six or more innings while giving up three or fewer earned runs is said to have achieved a \"quality start\". A starter that finishes the game without having to be relieved by the bullpen is said to have thrown a \"complete game\". The pitcher that throws a complete game is almost always in a position for a win.\\n\\n\\n== Pitch selection ==\\nStarting pitchers usually have a variety of pitches to choose from, broken into a number of categories.\\nFastballs: A pitch thrown hard (anywhere from the upper 80s to over 100 mph) and which generally follows a mostly straight trajectory. There are a number of different types of fastballs. The 4-seam fastball is the hardest thrown pitch, but also has very little movement or break to it. The 2-seam fastball is slightly slower than the 4-seam (generally in the mid 80s to low 90s), but breaks slightly inward to the pitcher\\'s throwing arm as well as drop slightly (i.e., a left-handed pitcher throwing a 2-seam fastball will have it tail slightly right-to-left). The cut fastball (cutter) is similar to the 2-seam in velocity, but breaks to the opposite side of a pitcher\\'s throwing arm (i.e., a right-handed pitcher will have it break right-to-left).\\nHard breaking balls: The most prominent of the hard breaking balls is the slider. A slider is a pitch that breaks sharply in the direction of the pitcher\\'s arm travel (left to right for a left-handed pitcher). It travels slower than a fastball (usually in the upper 70s to mid 80s) but faster than the slower breaking balls. The other two hard breaking balls are variants of the fastball, the sinker and the split-finger fastball (splitter). Both of these pitches break downwards from the point of release, with the sinker generally tailing slightly to the pitcher\\'s arm travel and the splitter tailing opposite. Both pitches are usually thrown in the low to upper 80s, although some travel upwards of 90 mph. The major difference is in their grip and the timing of their break. Like the cut fastball to the 2-seamer, the splitter tends to break much later in its flight path than the sinker does.\\nSoft breaking balls: The most common soft breaking ball is the eponymous curveball. The curve breaks in the direction of the pitcher\\'s arm travel from the point of release on through the entire arc of its flight. Curveballs travel from the low 60s to low 80s in speed. The other soft curveball is the screwball, which is essentially a reverse curve ball, as it breaks in the opposite direction of the pitcher\\'s arm travel. The screwball is a fairly rare pitch in modern baseball, as its manner of throwing puts a lot of stress on the arm and today\\'s maximum velocity/maximum effort pitchers can tear up their arms trying to use this pitch.\\nOther pitches: Two other major pitch styles are used by pitchers today, one far more so than others. The changeup, or palmball, is a slow pitch that is thrown with the same arm motion and arm velocity of a fastball, but with a much different grip that keeps the ball from achieving the same speed; usually the changeup is 10-20 mph slower than the pitcher\\'s fastballs. This visual distortion from a fast arm swing and a slower pitch is used to disrupt the hitter\\'s timing. The other major pitch style is the knuckleball. The knuckleball is a very difficult pitch to master, both for the pitcher (due to its unique grip and delivery manner) and for his catcher (due to the pitch being thoroughly unpredictable in its travel).\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nSetup man\\nMiddle reliever\\nClosing pitcher\\nLeft-handed specialist\\nLong reliever\\nList of World Series starting pitchers\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n^ For an evaluation of the relative merits of a four-man and a five-man rotation, see Rany Jazayerli, \"Doctoring The Numbers: The Five-Man Rotation, Part 3,\" BaseballProspectus.com (August 30, 2002).[1]\\n^ http://articles.mcall.com/2011-05-05/sports/mc-sports-buzz-050511_1_colonial-league-softball-volleyball-fans-nationals', u'Android (operating system)': u'Android is a mobile operating system (OS) based on the Linux kernel and currently developed by Google. With a user interface based on direct manipulation, Android is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, with specialized user interfaces for televisions (Android TV), cars (Android Auto), and wrist watches (Android Wear). The OS uses touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual keyboard. Despite being primarily designed for touchscreen input, it also has been used in game consoles, digital cameras, regular PCs (e.g. the HP Slate 21) and other electronics.\\nAndroid is the most widely used mobile OS and, as of 2013, the highest selling OS overall. Android devices sell more than Microsoft Windows, iOS, and Mac OS X devices combined, with sales in 2012, 2013 and 2014 close to the installed base of all PCs. As of July 2013 the Google Play store has had over 1 million Android apps published, and over 50 billion apps downloaded. A developer survey conducted in April\\u2013May 2013 found that 71% of mobile developers develop for Android. At Google I/O 2014, the company revealed that there were over 1 billion active monthly Android users, up from 538 million in June 2013.\\nAndroid\\'s source code is released by Google under open source licenses, although most Android devices ultimately ship with a combination of open source and proprietary software. Initially developed by Android, Inc., which Google backed financially and later bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007 along with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance\\u2014\\u200ba consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices.\\nAndroid is popular with technology companies which require a ready-made, low-cost and customizable operating system for high-tech devices. Android\\'s open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices which were officially released running other operating systems. The operating system\\'s success has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the so-called \"smartphone wars\" between technology companies.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nAndroid, Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California in October 2003 by Andy Rubin (co-founder of Danger), Rich Miner (co-founder of Wildfire Communications, Inc.), Nick Sears (once VP at T-Mobile), and Chris White (headed design and interface development at WebTV) to develop, in Rubin\\'s words, \"smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner\\'s location and preferences\". The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras. Though, when it was realized that the market for the devices was not large enough, the company diverted its efforts toward producing a smartphone operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile. Despite the past accomplishments of the founders and early employees, Android Inc. operated secretly, revealing only that it was working on software for mobile phones. That same year, Rubin ran out of money. Steve Perlman, a close friend of Rubin, brought him $10,000 in cash in an envelope and refused a stake in the company.\\nGoogle acquired Android Inc. on August 17, 2005; key employees of Android Inc., including Rubin, Miner, and White, stayed at the company after the acquisition. Not much was known about Android Inc. at the time, but many assumed that Google was planning to enter the mobile phone market with this move. At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradable system. Google had lined up a series of hardware component and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation on their part.\\nSpeculation about Google\\'s intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through December 2006. An earlier prototype codenamed \"Sooner\" had a closer resemblance to a BlackBerry phone, with no touchscreen, and a physical, QWERTY keyboard, but was later re-engineered to support a touchscreen, to compete with other announced devices such as the 2006 LG Prada and 2007 Apple iPhone. In September 2007, InformationWeek covered an Evalueserve study reporting that Google had filed several patent applications in the area of mobile telephony.\\n\\nOn November 5, 2007, the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of technology companies including Google, device manufacturers such as HTC, Sony and Samsung, wireless carriers such as Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile, and chipset makers such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, unveiled itself, with a goal to develop open standards for mobile devices. That day, Android was unveiled as its first product, a mobile device platform built on the Linux kernel version 2.6.25. The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC Dream, released on October 22, 2008.\\nIn 2010, Google launched its Nexus series of devices \\u2013  a line of smartphones and tablets running the Android operating system, and built by manufacturing partners. HTC collaborated with Google to release the first Nexus smartphone, the Nexus One. Google has since updated the series with newer devices, such as the Nexus 5 phone (made by LG) and the Nexus 7 tablet (made by Asus). Google releases the Nexus phones and tablets to act as their flagship Android devices, demonstrating Android\\'s latest software and hardware features. On March 13, 2013 Larry Page announced in a blog post that Andy Rubin had moved from the Android division to take on new projects at Google. He was replaced by Sundar Pichai, who also continues his role as the head of Google\\'s Chrome division, which develops Chrome OS.\\nSince 2008, Android has seen numerous updates which have incrementally improved the operating system, adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases. Each major release is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat; for example, version 1.5 Cupcake was followed by 1.6 Donut. Version 4.4.4 KitKat appeared as a security-only update; it was released on June 19, 2014, shortly after 4.4.3 was released. As of November 2014, the newest version of the Android operating system, Android 5.0 \"Lollipop\", is available for selected devices.\\nFrom 2010 to 2013, Hugo Barra served as product spokesperson for the Android team, representing Android at both press conferences and Google I/O, Google\\u2019s annual developer-focused conference. Barra\\u2019s product involvement included the entire Android ecosystem of software and hardware, including Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean and KitKat operating system launches, the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 smartphones, the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 tablets, and other related products such as Google Now and Google Voice Search, Google\\u2019s speech recognition product comparable to Apple\\u2019s Siri. In 2013, Barra left the Android team for Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi.\\n\\n\\n== Features ==\\n\\n\\n=== Interface ===\\n\\nAndroid\\'s default user interface is based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs, that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual keyboard. The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user. Internal hardware such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented, or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel.\\nAndroid devices boot to the homescreen, the primary navigation and information point on the device, which is similar to the desktop found on PCs. Android homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets; app icons launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content such as the weather forecast, the user\\'s email inbox, or a news ticker directly on the homescreen. A homescreen may be made up of several pages that the user can swipe back and forth between, though Android\\'s homescreen interface is heavily customisable, allowing the user to adjust the look and feel of the device to their tastes. Third-party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re-theme the homescreen, and even mimic the look of other operating systems, such as Windows Phone. Most manufacturers, and some wireless carriers, customise the look and feel of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors.\\nPresent along the top of the screen is a status bar, showing information about the device and its connectivity. This status bar can be \"pulled\" down to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates, such as a newly received email or SMS text, in a way that does not immediately interrupt or inconvenience the user. Notifications are persistent until read (by tapping, which opens the relevant app) or dismissed by sliding it off the screen. Beginning on Android 4.1, \"expanded notifications\" can display expanded details or additional functionality; for instance, a music player can display playback controls, and a \"missed call\" notification provides buttons for calling back or sending the caller an SMS message.\\nAndroid provides the ability to run applications which change the default launcher and hence the appearance and externally visible behaviour of Android. These appearance changes include a multi-page dock or no dock, and many more changes to fundamental features of the user interface.\\n\\n\\n=== Applications ===\\n\\nApplications (\"apps\"), that extend the functionality of devices, are written primarily in the Java programming language (without the usual \"write once, run anywhere\" claim of the Java platform) using the Android software development kit (SDK). The SDK includes a comprehensive set of development tools, including a debugger, software libraries, a handset emulator based on QEMU, documentation, sample code, and tutorials. The officially supported integrated development environment (IDE) is Eclipse using the Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin. Other development tools are available, including a Native Development Kit for applications or extensions in C or C++, Google App Inventor, a visual environment for novice programmers, and various cross platform mobile web applications frameworks. In January 2014, Google unveiled an Apache Cordova\\u2013based framework for porting Chrome HTML 5 applications to Android, wrapped in a native application shell.\\nAndroid has a growing selection of third-party applications, which can be acquired by users by downloading and installing the application\\'s APK file, or by downloading them using an application store program that allows users to install, update, and remove applications from their devices. Google Play Store is the primary application store installed on Android devices that comply with Google\\'s compatibility requirements and license the Google Mobile Services software. Google Play Store allows users to browse, download and update applications published by Google and third-party developers; As of July 2013, there are more than one million applications available for Android in Play Store. As of May 2013, 48 billion applications have been installed from Google Play Store and in July 2013, 50 billion applications were installed. Some carriers offer direct carrier billing for Google Play application purchases, where the cost of the application is added to the user\\'s monthly bill.\\nDue to the open nature of Android, a number of third-party application marketplace also exist for Android, either to provide a substitute for devices that are not allowed to ship with Google Play Store, provide applications that cannot be offered on Google Play Store due to policy violations, or for other reasons. Examples of these third-party stores have included the Amazon Appstore, GetJar, and SlideMe. F-Droid, another alternative marketplace, seeks to only provide applications that are distributed under free and open source licenses.\\n\\n\\n=== Memory management ===\\nSince Android devices are usually battery-powered, Android is designed to manage memory (RAM) to keep power consumption at a minimum, in contrast to desktop operating systems which generally assume they are connected to unlimited mains electricity. When an Android application is no longer in use, the system will automatically suspend it in memory; while the application is still technically \"open\", suspended applications consume no resources (for example, battery power or processing power) and sit idly in the background until needed again. This brings a dual benefit by increasing the general responsiveness of Android devices, since applications do not need to be closed and reopened from scratch each time, and by ensuring that background applications do not consume power needlessly.\\nAndroid manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the system will begin killing applications and processes that have been inactive for a while, in reverse order since they were last used (oldest first). This process is designed to be invisible to the user, so that users do not need to manage memory or the killing of applications themselves. As of 2011, third-party task killers were reported by Lifehacker as doing more harm than good.\\n\\n\\n== Hardware ==\\n\\nThe main hardware platform for Android is the ARM architecture (ARMv7 or later, Android 5.0 also supports ARMv8-A), with x86 and MIPS architectures also officially supported. Both 64-bit and 32-bit variants of all three architectures are supported since the release of Android 5.0. Since 2012, Android devices with Intel processors began to appear, including phones and tablets.\\nAs of November 2013, Android 4.4 recommends at least 512 MB of RAM, while for \"low RAM\" devices 340 MB is the required minimum amount that does not include memory dedicated to various hardware components such as the baseband processor. Android 4.4 requires a 32-bit ARMv7, MIPS or x86 architecture processor (latter two through unofficial ports), together with an OpenGL ES 2.0 compatible graphics processing unit (GPU). Android supports OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, 3.0 and 3.1. Some applications may explicitly require a certain version of the OpenGL ES, and suitable GPU hardware is required to run such applications.\\nAndroid devices incorporate many optional hardware components, including still or video cameras, GPS, orientation sensors, dedicated gaming controls, accelerometers, gyroscopes, barometers, magnetometers, proximity sensors, pressure sensors, thermometers, and touchscreens. Some hardware components are not required, but became standard in certain classes of devices, such as smartphones, and additional requirements apply if they are present. Some other hardware was initially required, but those requirements have been relaxed or eliminated altogether. For example, as Android was developed initially as a phone OS, hardware such as microphones were required, while over time the phone function became optional. Android used to require an autofocus camera, which was relaxed to a fixed-focus camera if it is even present at all, since the camera was dropped as a requirement entirely when Android started to be used on set-top boxes.\\nIn addition to running on smartphones and tablets, several vendors run Android natively on regular PC hardware with a keyboard and mouse. In addition to their availability on commercially available hardware, similar PC hardware\\u2013friendly versions of Android are freely available from the Android-x86 project, including customized Android 4.4. Using the Android emulator that is part of the Android SDK, or by using BlueStacks or Andy, Android can also run non-natively on x86. Chinese companies are building a PC and mobile operating system, based on Android, to \"compete directly with Microsoft Windows and Google Android\". The Chinese Academy of Engineering noted that \"more than a dozen\" companies were customising Android following a Chinese ban on the use of Windows 8 on government PCs.\\n\\n\\n== Development ==\\n\\nAndroid is developed in private by Google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released, at which point the source code is made available publicly. This source code will only run without modification on select devices, usually the Nexus series of devices. The source code is, in turn, adapted by OEMs to run on their hardware. Android\\'s source code does not contain the often proprietary device drivers that are needed for certain hardware components.\\nThe green Android logo was designed for Google in 2007 by graphic designer Irina Blok. The design team was tasked with a project to create a universally identifiable icon with the specific inclusion of a robot in the final design. After numerous design developments based on science-fiction and space movies, the team eventually sought inspiration from the human symbol on restroom doors and modified the figure into a robot shape. As Android is open-sourced, it was agreed that the logo should be likewise, and since its launch the green logo has been reinterpreted into countless variations on the original design.\\n\\n\\n=== Update schedule ===\\n\\nGoogle provides major incremental upgrades to Android every six to nine months, with confectionary-themed names, which most devices are capable of receiving over the air. The latest major release is Android 5.0 \"Lollipop\".\\nCompared to its chief rival mobile operating system, namely iOS, Android updates are typically slow to reach actual devices. For devices not under the Nexus brand, updates often arrive months from the time the given version is officially released. This is partly due to the extensive variation in hardware of Android devices, to which each upgrade must be specifically tailored, as the official Google source code only runs on their flagship Nexus devices. Porting Android to specific hardware is a time- and resource-consuming process for device manufacturers, who prioritize their newest devices and often leave older ones behind. Hence, older smartphones are frequently not updated if the manufacturer decides it is not worth their time, regardless of whether the phone is capable of running the update. This problem is compounded when manufacturers customize Android with their own interface and apps, which must be reapplied to each new release. Additional delays can be introduced by wireless carriers who, after receiving updates from manufacturers, further customize and brand Android to their needs and conduct extensive testing on their networks before sending the upgrade out to users.\\nThe lack of after-sale support from manufacturers and carriers has been widely criticized by consumer groups and the technology media. Some commentators have noted that the industry has a financial incentive not to upgrade their devices, as the lack of updates for existing devices fuels the purchase of newer ones, an attitude described as \"insulting\". The Guardian has complained that the method of distribution for updates is complicated only because manufacturers and carriers have designed it that way. In 2011, Google partnered with a number of industry players to announce an \"Android Update Alliance\", pledging to deliver timely updates for every device for 18 months after its release; however, there has not been another official word about that alliance.\\nIn 2012, Google began decoupling certain aspects of the operating system (particularly core applications) so they could be updated through Google Play Store, independently of Android itself. One of these components, Google Play Services, is a closed-source system-level process providing APIs for Google services, installed automatically on nearly all devices running Android version 2.2 and higher. With these changes, Google can add new operating system functionality through Play Services and application updates without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself. As a result, Android 4.2 and 4.3 contained relatively fewer user-facing changes, focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements.\\n\\n\\n=== Linux kernel ===\\nAndroid\\'s kernel is based on one of the Linux kernel\\'s long-term support (LTS) branches. Since April 2014, Android devices mainly use version 3.4 of the Linux kernel or newer, such as the version 3.14 used in Android 5.0. The specific kernel version depends on the actual Android device and its hardware platform; Android has used various kernel versions since the version 2.6.25 that was used in Android 1.0.\\nAndroid\\'s variant of the Linux kernel has further architectural changes that are implemented by Google outside the typical Linux kernel development cycle, such as the inclusion of components like Binder, ashmem, pmem, logger, wakelocks, and different out-of-memory (OOM) handling. Certain features that Google contributed back to the Linux kernel, notably a power management feature called \"wakelocks\", were rejected by mainline kernel developers partly because they felt that Google did not show any intent to maintain its own code. Google announced in April 2010 that they would hire two employees to work with the Linux kernel community, but Greg Kroah-Hartman, the current Linux kernel maintainer for the stable branch, said in December 2010 that he was concerned that Google was no longer trying to get their code changes included in mainstream Linux. Some Google Android developers hinted that \"the Android team was getting fed up with the process,\" because they were a small team and had more urgent work to do on Android.\\nIn August 2011, Linus Torvalds said that \"eventually Android and Linux would come back to a common kernel, but it will probably not be for four to five years\". In December 2011, Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the start of Android Mainlining Project, which aims to put some Android drivers, patches and features back into the Linux kernel, starting in Linux 3.3. Linux included the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the 3.5 kernel, after many previous attempts at merger. The interfaces are the same but the upstream Linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes: to memory (the traditional suspend that Android uses), and to disk (hibernate, as it is known on the desktop). Google maintains a public code repository that contains their experimental work to re-base Android off the latest stable Linux versions.\\nThe flash storage on Android devices is split into several partitions, such as /system for the operating system itself, and /data for user data and application installations. In contrast to desktop Linux distributions, Android device owners are not given root access to the operating system and sensitive partitions such as /system are read-only. However, root access can be obtained by exploiting security flaws in Android, which is used frequently by the open-source community to enhance the capabilities of their devices, but also by malicious parties to install viruses and malware.\\nAndroid is a Linux distribution according to the Linux Foundation, Google\\'s open-source chief Chris DiBona, and several journalists. Others, such as Google engineer Patrick Brady, say that Android is not Linux in the traditional Unix-like Linux distribution sense; Android does not include the GNU C Library and some of other components typically found in Linux distributions.\\n\\n\\n=== Software stack ===\\n\\nOn top of the Linux kernel, there are the middleware, libraries and APIs written in C, and application software running on an application framework which includes Java-compatible libraries based on Apache Harmony. Development of the Linux kernel continues independently of other Android\\'s source code bases.\\nUntil version 5.0, Android used Dalvik as a process virtual machine with just-in-time (JIT) compilation to run Dalvik \"dex-code\" (Dalvik Executable), which is usually translated from the Java bytecode. Following the JIT principle, Dalvik performs the compilation each time an application is launched. Android 4.4 introduced Android Runtime (ART) as a new runtime environment, which uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to compile the bytecode upon the installation of an application. In Android 4.4, ART was an experimental feature and not enabled by default; it became the only runtime option in the next major version of Android, 5.0.\\nAndroid\\'s standard C library, Bionic, was developed by Google specifically for Android, as a derivation of the BSD\\'s standard C library code. Bionic itself has been designed with several major features specific to the Linux kernel. The main benefits of using Bionic instead of the GNU C Library (glibc) or uClibc are its smaller runtime footprint, and optimization for low-frequency CPUs. At the same time, Bionic is licensed under the terms of BSD licence, which Google finds more suitable for the Android\\'s overall licensing model.\\nAiming for a different licensing model, toward the end of 2012 Google switched the Bluetooth stack in Android from the GPL-licensed BlueZ to the Apache-licensed BlueDroid.\\nAndroid does not have a native X Window System by default, nor does it support the full set of standard GNU libraries. This made it difficult to port existing Linux applications or libraries to Android, until version r5 of the Android Native Development Kit brought support for applications written completely in C or C++. Libraries written in C may also be used in applications by injection of a small shim and usage of the JNI.\\n\\n\\n=== Open-source community ===\\nAndroid has an active community of developers and enthusiasts who use the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system. These community-developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels, albeit without as extensive testing or quality assurance; provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates; or bring Android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems, such as the HP TouchPad. Community releases often come pre-rooted and contain modifications unsuitable for non-technical users, such as the ability to overclock or over/undervolt the device\\'s processor. CyanogenMod is the most widely used community firmware, and acts as a foundation for numerous others.\\nHistorically, device manufacturers and mobile carriers have typically been unsupportive of third-party firmware development. Manufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the support costs resulting from this. Moreover, modified firmwares such as CyanogenMod sometimes offer features, such as tethering, for which carriers would otherwise charge a premium. As a result, technical obstacles including locked bootloaders and restricted access to root permissions are common in many devices. However, as community-developed software has grown more popular, and following a statement by the Librarian of Congress in the United States that permits the \"jailbreaking\" of mobile devices, manufacturers and carriers have softened their position regarding third party development, with some, including HTC, Motorola, Samsung and Sony, providing support and encouraging development. As a result of this, over time the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware has lessened as an increasing number of devices are shipped with unlocked or unlockable bootloaders, similar to Nexus series of phones, although usually requiring that users waive their devices\\' warranties to do so. However, despite manufacturer acceptance, some carriers in the US still require that phones are locked down, frustrating developers and customers.\\n\\n\\n== Security and privacy ==\\n\\nAndroid applications run in a sandbox, an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the system\\'s resources, unless access permissions are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed. Before installing an application, Play Store displays all required permissions: a game may need to enable vibration or save data to an SD card, for example, but should not need to read SMS messages or access the phonebook. After reviewing these permissions, the user can choose to accept or refuse them, installing the application only if they accept. The sandboxing and permissions system lessens the impact of vulnerabilities and bugs in applications, but developer confusion and limited documentation has resulted in applications routinely requesting unnecessary permissions, reducing its effectiveness. Google has now pushed an update to Android Verify Apps feature, which will now run in background to detect malicious processes and crack them down.\\nThe \"App Ops\" privacy and application permissions control system, used for internal development and testing by Google, was introduced in Google\\'s Android 4.3 release for the Nexus devices. Initially hidden, the feature was discovered publicly; it allowed users to install a management application and approve or deny permission requests individually for each of the applications installed on a device. Access to the App Ops was later restricted by Google starting with Android 4.4.2 with an explanation that the feature was accidentally enabled and not intended for end-users; for such a decision, Google received criticism from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Individual application permissions management, through the App Ops or third-party tools, is currently only possible with root access to the device.\\nResearch from security company Trend Micro lists premium service abuse as the most common type of Android malware, where text messages are sent from infected phones to premium-rate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user. Other malware displays unwanted and intrusive adverts on the device, or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties. Security threats on Android are reportedly growing exponentially; however, Google engineers have argued that the malware and virus threat on Android is being exaggerated by security companies for commercial reasons, and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to users. Google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely rare, and a survey conducted by F-Secure showed that only 0.5% of Android malware reported had come from the Google Play store.\\nGoogle currently uses Google Bouncer malware scanner to watch over and scan the Google Play store apps. It is intended to flag up suspicious apps and warn users of any potential threat with an application before they download it. Android version 4.2 Jelly Bean was released in 2012 with enhanced security features, including a malware scanner built into the system, which works in combination with Google Play but can scan apps installed from third party sources as well, and an alert system which notifies the user when an app tries to send a premium-rate text message, blocking the message unless the user explicitly authorises it. Several security firms, such as Lookout Mobile Security, AVG Technologies, and McAfee, have released antivirus software for Android devices. This software is ineffective as sandboxing also applies to such applications, limiting their ability to scan the deeper system for threats.\\nAndroid smartphones have the ability to report the location of Wi-Fi access points, encountered as phone users move around, to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points. These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones, allowing them to run apps like Foursquare, Google Latitude, Facebook Places, and to deliver location-based ads. Third party monitoring software such as TaintDroid, an academic research-funded project, can, in some cases, detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote servers. In August 2013, Google released Android Device Manager (ADM), a component that allows users to remotely track, locate, and wipe their Android device through a web interface. In December 2013, Google released ADM as an Android application on the Google Play store, where it is available to devices running Android version 2.2 and higher.\\nThe open-source nature of Android allows security contractors to take existing devices and adapt them for highly secure uses. For example Samsung has worked with General Dynamics through their Open Kernel Labs acquisition to rebuild Jelly Bean on top of their hardened microvisor for the \"Knox\" project.\\nAs part of the broader 2013 mass surveillance disclosures it was revealed in September 2013 that the American and British intelligence agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA) and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) respectively, have access to the user data on iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android devices. They are reportedly able to read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, emails, and notes. Further reports in January 2014 revealed the intelligence agencies capabilities to intercept the personal information transmitted across the internet by social networks and other popular apps such as Angry Birds, which collect personal information of their users for advertising and other commercial reasons. GCHQ has, according to The Guardian, a wiki-style guide of different apps and advertising networks, and the different data that can be siphoned from each. Later that week, the Finnish Angry Birds developer Rovio announced that it was reconsidering its relationships with its advertising platforms in the light of these revelations, and called upon the wider industry to do the same.\\nThe documents revealed a further effort by the intelligence agencies to intercept Google Maps searches and queries submitted from Android and other smartphones to collect location information in bulk. The NSA and GCHQ insist their activities are in compliance with all relevant domestic and international laws, although the Guardian stated \"the latest disclosures could also add to mounting public concern about how the technology sector collects and uses information, especially for those outside the US, who enjoy fewer privacy protections than Americans.\"\\n\\n\\n== Licensing ==\\n\\nThe source code for Android is open source; it is developed in private by Google, with the source code released publicly when a new version of Android is released. Google publishes most of the code (including network and telephony stacks) under the non-copyleft Apache License version 2.0. which allows modification and redistribution. The license does not grant rights to the \"Android\" trademark, so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have to license it from Google under individual contracts. Associated Linux kernel changes are released under the copyleft GNU General Public License version 2, developed by the Open Handset Alliance, with the source code publicly available at all times. Typically, Google collaborates with a hardware manufacturer to produce a flagship device (part of the Nexus series) featuring the new version of Android, then makes the source code available after that device has been released. The only Android release which was not immediately made available as source code was the tablet-only 3.0 Honeycomb release. The reason, according to Andy Rubin in an official Android blog post, was because Honeycomb was rushed for production of the Motorola Xoom, and they did not want third parties creating a \"really bad user experience\" by attempting to put onto smartphones a version of Android intended for tablets.\\nWhile all of Android itself is open source software, most Android devices ship with a large amount of proprietary software, such as Google Mobile Services, which includes apps such as Google Play Store, Google Search, and Google Play Services\\u2014a software layer which provides APIs that integrate with Google-provided services, among others. These apps must be licensed from Google by device makers, and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility guidelines and other requirements. Custom, certified distributions of Android produced by manufacturers (such as TouchWiz and HTC Sense) may also replace certain stock Android apps with their own proprietary variants and add additional software not included in the stock Android operating system. There may also be \"binary blob\" drivers required for certain hardware components in the device.\\nSeveral stock apps in Android\\'s open source code used by previous versions (such as Search, Music, and Calendar) have also been effectively deprecated by Google, with development having shifted to newer but proprietary versions distributed and updated through Play Store, such as Google Search and Google Play Music. While these older apps remain in Android\\'s source code, they have no longer received any major updates. Additionally, proprietary variants of the stock Camera and Gallery apps also include certain functions (such as Photosphere panoramas and Google+ album integration) that are excluded from open source versions (however, they have yet to be completely abandoned). Similarly, the Nexus 5 uses a non-free variation of Android 4.4\\'s home screen that is embedded directly within the Google Search app, adding voice-activated search and the ability to access Google Now as a page on the home screen itself. Although an update for Google Search app containing the relevant components was released through Google Play for all Android devices, the new home screen required an additional stub application to function, and was not provided in Android 4.4 updates for any other devices (which still used the existing home screen from Android version 4.3). The stub application was officially released on Play Store as Google Now Launcher in February 2014, initially for Nexus and Google Play Edition devices with Android version 4.4.\\nRichard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation have been critical of Android and have recommended the usage of alternatives such as Replicant, because drivers and firmware vital for the proper functioning of Android devices are usually proprietary, and because Google Play can forcibly install or deinstall apps and invites non-free software.\\n\\n\\n=== Leverage over manufacturers ===\\nGoogle Mobile Services software, along with Android trademarks, can only be licensed by hardware manufacturers for devices that meet Google\\'s compatibility standards contained within Android Compatibility Definition Document. Thus, forks of Android that make major changes to the operating system itself do not include any of Google\\'s non-free components, stay incompatible with applications that require them, and must ship with an alternative software marketplace in lieu of Google Play Store. Examples of such Android forks are the Amazon\\'s Fire OS (which is used on the Kindle Fire line of tablets, and oriented toward Amazon services), the Nokia X Software Platform (a fork used by the Nokia X family, oriented primarily toward Nokia and Microsoft services), and other forks that exclude Google apps due to the general unavailability of Google service in that country and licensing fees (such as in China). In 2014, Google also began to require that all Android devices which license the Google Mobile Services software display a prominent \"Powered by Android\" logo on their boot screens.\\nMembers of the Open Handset Alliance, which include the majority of Android OEMs, are also contractually forbidden from producing Android devices based on forks of the OS; in 2012, Acer Inc. was forced by Google to halt production on a device powered by Alibaba Group\\'s Aliyun OS with threats of removal from the OHA, as Google deemed the platform to be an incompatible version of Android. Alibaba Group defended the allegations, arguing that the OS was a distinct platform from Android (primarily using HTML5 apps), but incorporated portions of Android\\'s platform to allow backwards compatibility with third-party Android software. Indeed, the devices did ship with an application store which offered Android apps; however, the majority of them were pirated.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\nAndroid received a lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in 2007. Although analysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had partnered with Google to form the Open Handset Alliance, it was unclear whether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing operating systems with Android. The idea of an open-source, Linux-based development platform sparked interest, but there were additional worries about Android facing strong competition from established players in the smartphone market, such as Nokia and Microsoft, and rival Linux mobile operating systems that were in development. These established players were skeptical: Nokia was quoted as saying \"we don\\'t see this as a threat,\" and a member of Microsoft\\'s Windows Mobile team stated \"I don\\'t understand the impact that they are going to have.\"\\nSince then Android has grown to become the most widely used smartphone operating system and \"one of the fastest mobile experiences available.\" Reviewers have highlighted the open-source nature of the operating system as one of its defining strengths, allowing companies such as Microsoft (Nokia X family), Amazon (Kindle Fire), Barnes & Noble (Nook), Ouya, Baidu and others to fork the software and release hardware running their own customised version of Android. As a result, it has been described by technology website Ars Technica as \"practically the default operating system for launching new hardware\" for companies without their own mobile platforms. This openness and flexibility is also present at the level of the end user: Android allows extensive customisation of devices by their owners and apps are freely available from non-Google app stores and third party websites. These have been cited as among the main advantages of Android phones over others.\\nDespite Android\\'s popularity, including an activation rate three times that of iOS, there have been reports that Google has not been able to leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn Android into the money maker that analysts had expected. The Verge suggested that Google is losing control of Android due to the extensive customization and proliferation of non-Google apps and services\\u2014Amazon\\'s Kindle Fire line uses Fire OS, a heavily modified fork of Android which does not include or support any of Google\\'s proprietary components, and requires that users obtain software from its competing Amazon Appstore instead of Play Store. In 2014, in an effort to improve prominence of the Android brand, Google began to require that devices featuring its proprietary components display an Android logo on the boot screen.\\nAndroid has suffered from \"fragmentation\", a situation where the variety of Android devices, in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them, makes the task of developing applications that work consistently across the ecosystem harder than rival platforms such as iOS where hardware and software varies less. For example, according to data from OpenSignal in July 2013, there were 11,868 models of Android device, numerous different screen sizes and eight Android OS versions simultaneously in use, while the large majority of iOS users have upgraded to the latest iteration of that OS. Critics such as Apple Insider have asserted that fragmentation via hardware and software pushed Android\\'s growth through large volumes of low end, budget-priced devices running older versions of Android. They maintain this forces Android developers to write for the \"lowest common denominator\" to reach as many users as possible, who have too little incentive to make use of the latest hardware or software features only available on a smaller percentage of devices. However, OpenSignal, who develops both Android and iOS apps, concluded that although fragmentation can make development trickier, Android\\'s wider global reach also increases the potential reward.\\n\\n\\n=== Market share ===\\n\\nResearch company Canalys estimated in the second quarter of 2009 that Android had a 2.8% share of worldwide smartphone shipments. By the fourth quarter of 2010 this had grown to 33% of the market, becoming the top-selling smartphone platform, overtaking Symbian. By the third quarter of 2011 Gartner estimated that more than half (52.5%) of the smartphone sales belonged to Android. By the third quarter of 2012 Android had a 75% share of the global smartphone market according to the research firm IDC.\\nIn July 2011, Google said that 550,000 new Android devices were being activated every day, up from 400,000 per day in May, and more than 100 million devices had been activated with 4.4% growth per week. In September 2012, 500 million devices had been activated with 1.3 million activations per day. In May 2013, at Google I/O, Sundar Pichai announced that 900 million Android devices had been activated.\\nAndroid market share varies by location. In July 2012, \"mobile subscribers aged 13+\" in the United States using Android were up to 52%, and rose to 90% in China. During the third quarter of 2012, Android\\'s worldwide smartphone shipment market share was 75%, with 750 million devices activated in total. In April 2013 Android had 1.5 million activations per day. As of May 2013, 48 billion apps have been installed from the Google Play store, and by September 2013, 1 billion Android devices have been activated.\\nAndroid has the largest installed base of any mobile operating system and, as of 2013, devices running it also sell more than Windows, iOS and Mac OS X devices combined. In the third quarter of 2013, Android\\'s share of the global smartphone shipment market was 81.3%, the highest ever, and the Android share\\u2014\\u200bled by Samsung products\\u2014\\u200bwas 81.3%; During this time period over 261 million smartphones were sold globally, with around 211 million of those running Android.\\nAs of July 2013, the Google Play store has had over 1 million Android apps published, and over 50 billion apps downloaded. A developer survey conducted in April\\u2013May 2013 found that Android is used by 71% of mobile developers. The operating system\\'s success has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the so-called \"smartphone wars\" between technology companies.\\nAndroid devices account for more than half of smartphone sales in most markets, including the US, while \"[o]nly in Japan was Apple on top\" (September\\u2013November 2013 numbers). At the end of 2013, over 1.5 billion Android smartphones have been sold in the four years since 2010, making Android the most sold phone and tablet OS. Three billion Android smartphones are estimated to be sold by the end of 2014 (including previous years). According to Gartner research company, Android-based devices outsold all contenders, every year since 2012. In 2013, it outsold Windows 2.8:1 or by 573 million.\\nSince July 2014, Android is the most popular mobile operating system to browse the web according to NetApplications. In India, and other countries, Android is the most popular operating system (not just counting \"mobile\" ones) for browsing the web, according to StatCounter; \"Mobile usage has already overtaken desktop in several countries including India, South Africa and Saudi Arabia\" with several countries in Africa having done so already, including Ethiopia and Kenia (there mobile is 72.23%).\\nWhile Android phones in the west commonly include Google\\'s proprietary add-ons (such as Google Play) to the otherwise open source operating system, increasingly this is not done in emerging markets; \"ABI Research claims that 65 million devices shipped globally with open-source Android in the second quarter of [2014], up from 54 million in the first quarter\"; depending on country, percent of phones estimated to be based only on Android\\'s source code (AOSP), forgoing the Android trademark: Thailand (44%), Philippines (38%), Indonesia (31%), India (21%), Malaysia (24%), Mexico (18%), Brazil (9%).\\nAccording to Gartner \"Android surpassed a billion shipments of devices in 2014, and will continue to grow at a double-digit pace in 2015, with a 26 percent increase year over year.\" They expect the whole mobile phone market to \"reach two billion units in 2016\" (e.g. including Android). Never before has any operating system (for general purpose computers) sold over one billion in a year and others are not close in the year 2014; with Android selling over four times more than Apple\\'s operating systems and more than three times Microsoft\\'s Windows.\\n\\n\\n==== Tablets ====\\n\\nDespite its success on smartphones, initially Android tablet adoption was slow. One of the main causes was the chicken or the egg situation where consumers were hesitant to buy an Android tablet due to a lack of high quality tablet apps, but developers were hesitant to spend time and resources developing tablet apps until there was a significant market for them. The content and app \"ecosystem\" proved more important than hardware specs as the selling point for tablets. Due to the lack of Android tablet-specific apps in 2011, early Android tablets had to make do with existing smartphone apps that were ill-suited to larger screen sizes, whereas the dominance of Apple\\'s iPad was reinforced by the large number of tablet-specific iOS apps.\\nDespite app support in its infancy, a considerable number of Android tablets (alongside those using other operating systems, such as the HP TouchPad and BlackBerry PlayBook) were rushed out to market in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the iPad. InfoWorld has suggested that some Android manufacturers initially treated their first tablets as a \"Frankenphone business\", a short-term low-investment opportunity by placing a smartphone-optimized Android OS (before Android 3.0 Honeycomb for tablets was available) on a device while neglecting user interface. This approach, such as with the Dell Streak, failed to gain market traction with consumers as well as damaging the early reputation of Android tablets. Furthermore, several Android tablets such as the Motorola Xoom were priced the same or higher than the iPad, which hurt sales. An exception was the Amazon Kindle Fire, which relied upon lower pricing as well as access to Amazon\\'s ecosystem of apps and content.\\nThis began to change in 2012 with the release of the affordable Nexus 7 and a push by Google for developers to write better tablet apps. According to International Data Corporation, shipments of Android-powered tablets surpassed iPads in Q3 2012.\\nAt end of 2013, over 191.6 million Android tablets had sold in three years since 2011. This made Android tablets the most-sold type of tablet in 2013, surpassing iPads in the second quarter of 2013.\\n\\n\\n=== Platform usage ===\\n\\nCharts in this section provide breakdowns of Android versions, based on the devices accessing the Play Store in a seven-day period ending on January 5, 2015. Therefore, these statistics exclude Android forks that do not access Google Play, such as Amazon\\'s Fire tablets.\\n\\n\\n=== Application piracy ===\\nIn general, paid Android applications can easily be pirated. In a May 2012 interview with Eurogamer, the developers of Football Manager stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate players was 9:1 for their game Football Manager Handheld. However, not every developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue; for example, in July 2012 the developers of the game Wind-up Knight said that piracy levels of their game were only 12%, and most of the piracy came from China, where people cannot purchase apps from Google Play.\\nIn 2010, Google released a tool for validating authorized purchases for use within apps, but developers complained that this was insufficient and trivial to crack. Google responded that the tool, especially its initial release, was intended as a sample framework for developers to modify and build upon depending on their needs, not as a finished piracy solution. In 2012 Google released a feature in Android 4.1 that encrypted paid applications so that they would only work on the device on which they were originally installed from the Google Play Store, but this feature has been temporarily deactivated due to technical issues.\\n\\n\\n== Legal issues ==\\n\\nBoth Android and Android phone manufacturers have been involved in numerous patent lawsuits. On August 12, 2010, Oracle sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the Java programming language. Oracle originally sought damages up to $6.1 billion, but this valuation was rejected by a United States federal judge who asked Oracle to revise the estimate. In response, Google submitted multiple lines of defense, counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle\\'s patents or copyright, that Oracle\\'s patents were invalid, and several other defenses. They said that Android is based on Apache Harmony, a clean room implementation of the Java class libraries, and an independently developed virtual machine called Dalvik. In May 2012, the jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle\\'s patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable. The parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for a small amount of copied code. On May 9, 2014, the Federal Circuit partially reversed the district court ruling, ruling in Oracle\\'s favor on the copyrightability issue, and remanding the issue of fair use to the district court.\\nIn addition to lawsuits against Google directly, various proxy wars have been waged against Android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of Android devices, with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an Android device to market. Both Apple and Microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement, with Apple\\'s ongoing legal action against Samsung being a particularly high-profile case. In October 2011, Microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with ten Android device manufacturers, whose products account for \"70% in the U.S.\".  and 55% of the worldwide revenue for Android devices. These include Samsung and HTC. Samsung\\'s patent settlement with Microsoft includes an agreement that Samsung will allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running Microsoft\\'s Windows Phone operating system.\\nGoogle has publicly expressed its frustration for the current patent landscape in the United States, accusing Apple, Oracle and Microsoft of trying to take down Android through patent litigation, rather than innovating and competing with better products and services. In 2011\\u201312, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion, which was viewed in part as a defensive measure to protect Android, since Motorola Mobility held more than 17,000 patents. In December 2011, Google bought over a thousand patents from IBM.\\nIn 2013, FairSearch, a lobbying organization supported by Microsoft, Oracle and others, filed a complaint regarding Android with the European Commission, alleging that its free-of-charge distribution model constituted anti-competitive predatory pricing. The Free Software Foundation Europe, whose donors include Google, disputed the Fairsearch allegations.\\n\\n\\n== Use outside of smartphones and tablets ==\\n\\nThe open and customizable nature of Android allows it to be used on other electronics aside from smartphones and tablets, including laptops and netbooks, smartbooks, smart TVs (Android TV, Google TV) and cameras (E.g. Galaxy Camera). In addition, the Android operating system has seen applications on smart glasses (Google Glass), smartwatches, headphones, car CD and DVD players, mirrors, portable media players, landline and Voice over IP phones. Ouya, a video game console running Android, became one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns, crowdfunding US$8.5m for its development, and was later followed by other Android-based consoles, such as Nvidia\\'s Project Shield \\u2013  an Android device in a video game controller form factor.\\nIn 2011, Google demonstrated \"Android@Home\", a home automation technology which uses Android to control a range of household devices including light switches, power sockets and thermostats. Prototype light bulbs were announced that could be controlled from an Android phone or tablet, but Android head Andy Rubin was cautious to note that \"turning a lightbulb on and off is nothing new\", pointing to numerous failed home automation services. Google, he said, was thinking more ambitiously and the intention was to use their position as a cloud services provider to bring Google products into customers\\' homes.\\nParrot unveiled an Android-based car stereo system known as Asteroid in 2011, followed by a successor, the touchscreen-based Asteroid Smart, in 2012. In 2013, Clarion released its own Android-based car stereo, the AX1. In January 2014 at Consumer Electronics Show, Google announced the formation of the Open Automotive Alliance, a group including several major automobile makers (Audi, General Motors, Hyundai, and Honda) and Nvidia, which aims to produce Android-based in car entertainment systems for automobiles, \"[bringing] the best of Android into the automobile in a safe and seamless way.\"\\nOn March 18, 2014, Google announced Android Wear, an Android-based platform specifically intended for smartwatches and other wearable devices; only a developer preview was made publicly available. This was followed by the unveiling of two Android Wear\\u2013based devices, the LG G Watch and Moto 360.\\nOn June 25, 2014, at Google I/O, it was announced that Android TV, a Smart TV platform, is replacing the previously released Google TV. On June 26, 2014, Google announced Android Auto for the car.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\nSergey Brin introduces the Android platform on YouTube', u\"3200 series (Chicago 'L')\": u'The 3200 series (numbered 3201\\u20133457) is a series of Chicago \\'L\\' car built between 1992 and 1994 by Morrison-Knudsen. 257 cars were built. As of 2015, 253 of them remain in service. The bodyshells of these cars were built by Mafersa, of Brazil, as a subcontractor to Morrison-Knudsen.\\nThe 3200 series was the last series of five interoperable series of Chicago \\'L\\' cars known as the High Performance Family and the last cars ordered for the Chicago Transit Authority that use direct current motors. Subsequent train orders are using alternating current motors.\\nThe original order for 256 cars was motivated primarily by the impending opening of the Orange Line, which would need new cars when it opened in October 1993. The order was completed in 1994. The 3200-series contains many innovations over the previous 2600-series. Computers control much of the cab functions and simplify operation for the motorman. Diagnostics are also easier to perform on this series than on previous series. In addition, fluted steel siding is included on these cars for the first time since the 2200-series, in order to reduce graffiti. The series also introduced openable hopper windows for use in case of air conditioner failure.\\nCars 3441-3456 were originally equipped with pantographs for use on the Yellow Line, which was powered by overhead lines until 2004. The pantographs on 3451-3456 were removed in the late 1990s when they were reassigned to supplement the Brown Line, while the rest lost their pantographs when the Yellow Line was converted to third rail power in 2004.\\nCar 3457 was an additional car built specifically for the purpose of serving as a mate to the 2600-series car 3032, after its mate 3031 had been damaged from a derailment at Wilson station on March 15, 1988. 3032 was subsequently renumbered 3458. The pair currently runs on the Brown Line.\\nThe 3200-series cars are currently all assigned to the Orange and Brown Lines and make up the latter\\'s entire fleet. At various points during their service life a small number were also assigned to the Yellow and Purple Lines.\\n\\n\\n== Future overhaul ==\\nIn May 2014, two trainsets (one on the Brown Line and one on the Orange Line) were retrofitted with multicolor LED destination signs similar to those on the 5000-series cars as a pilot project for a future overhaul for the cars. The overhaul plans have been approved as of August 14, 2014. In addition to new multicolor LED destination signs, new air conditioning systems will also be installed, and the propulsion systems, passenger door motors, and wheel and axle assemblies will be rebuilt. The 3200 series rehabilitation began in 2015 and will be completed in 2019.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\"CTA Car Assignments\". Chicago-\\'L\\'.org.

It lies on the north bank of the Mohawk River in Saratoga County.\\n\\nCrescent was the northern terminus of an aqueduct which carried the Erie Canal over the Mohawk River. The original wooden aqueduct was built in 1825. The 26-arched stone aqueduct which replaced the wooden structure, was demolished in 1918 and only fragments of the stone piers remain.\\nIn the 1840s the cheap transportation provided by the canal spurred economic development in Crescent. Industry including a paint works, an iron foundry, and brickworks, located there, and businesses supplying the canal boats prospered. Grain was transhipped at Crescent; it was said \"teams in a line half a mile long having been seen waiting for a chance to unload.\" In 1860 the population was 593.\\nToday Crescent is the location of the Crescent Bridge carrying U.S. Route 9 from Albany County.\\nThe Crescent Methodist Episcopal Church (now demolished), Noxon Bank Building, and Oakcliff are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOld Crescent Aqueduct - Erie Canal (photos)', u'Ultra vires': u'Ultra vires is a Latin phrase meaning \"beyond the powers\". If an act requires legal authority and it is done with such authority, it is characterised in law as intra vires (\"within the powers\"). If it is done without such authority, it is ultra vires. Acts that are intra vires may equivalently be termed \"valid\" and those that are ultra vires \"invalid\".\\n\\n\\n== Corporate law ==\\n\\nIn corporate law, ultra vires describes acts attempted by a corporation that are beyond the scope of powers granted by the corporation\\'s objects clause, articles of incorporation or in a clause in its Bylaws, in the laws authorizing a corporation\\'s formation, or similar founding documents. Acts attempted by a corporation that are beyond the scope of its charter are void or voidable.\\nAn ultra vires transaction cannot be ratified by shareholders, even if they wish it to be ratified.\\nThe doctrine of estoppel usually precluded reliance on the defense of ultra vires where the transaction was fully performed by one party.\\nA fortiori, a transaction which was fully performed by both parties could not be attacked.\\nIf the contract was fully executory, the defense of ultra vires might be raised by either party.\\nIf the contract was partially performed, and the performance was held to be insufficient to bring the doctrine of estoppel into play, a suit for quasi contract for recovery of benefits conferred was available.\\nIf an agent of the corporation committed a tort within the scope of his or her employment, the corporation could not defend on the ground the act was ultra vires.\\nSeveral modern developments relating to corporate formation have limited the probability that ultra vires acts will occur. Except in the case of non-profit corporations (including municipal corporations), this legal doctrine is obsolescent; within recent years, almost all business corporations are chartered to allow them to transact any lawful business. The Model Business Corporation Act of the United States states that: \"The validity of corporate action may not be challenged on the ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act.\" The doctrine still has some life among non-profit corporations or state-created corporate bodies established for a specific public purpose, like universities or charities.\\nAccording to American laws, the concept of ultra vires can still arise in the following kinds of activities in some states:\\nCharitable or political contributions\\nGuaranty of indebtedness of another\\nLoans to officers or directors\\nPensions, bonuses, stock option plans, job severance payments, and other fringe benefits\\nThe power to acquire shares of other corporations\\nThe power to enter into a partnership\\n\\n\\n=== United Kingdom ===\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, the Companies Act 2006 sections 31 and 39 greatly reduced the applicability of ultra vires in corporate law, although it can still apply in relation to charities and a shareholder may apply for an injunction, in advance only, to prevent an act which is claimed to be ultra vires.\\nIn many jurisdictions, such as Australia, legislation provides that a corporation has all the powers of a natural person plus others; also, the validity of acts which are made ultra vires is preserved.\\n\\n\\n== Constitutional law ==\\nUnder constitutional law, particularly in Canada and the United States, constitutions give federal and provincial or state governments various powers. To go outside those powers would be ultra vires; for example, although the court did not use the term in striking down a federal law in United States v. Lopez on the grounds that it exceeded the Constitutional authority of Congress, the Supreme Court still declared the law to be ultra vires.{U.S. v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 567 (1995)}\\nAccording to Article 15.2 of the Irish constitution, the Oireachtas (parliament) is the sole lawmaking body in the Republic of Ireland. In the case of CityView Press v AnCo, however, the Irish Supreme Court held that the Oireachtas may delegate certain powers to subordinate bodies through primary legislation, so long as these delegated powers allow the delegatee only to further the principles and policies laid down by the Oireachtas in primary legislation and not craft new principles or policies themselves. Any piece of primary legislation that grants the power to make public policy to a body other than the Oireachtas is unconstitutional; however, as there is a presumption in Irish constitutional law that the Oireachtas acts within the confines of the Constitution, any legislation passed by the Oireachtas must be interpreted in such a way as to be constitutionally valid where possible.\\nThus, in a number of cases where bodies other than the Oireachtas were found to have used powers granted to them by primary legislation to make public policy, the impugned primary legislation was read in such a way that it would not have the effect of allowing a subordinate body to make public policy. In these cases, the primary legislation was held to be constitutional, but the subordinate or secondary legislation, which amounted to creation of public policy, was held to be ultra vires the primary legislation and was struck down.\\nIn UK constitutional law, ultra vires describes patents, ordinances and the like enacted under the prerogative powers of the Crown that contradict statutes enacted by the King-in-Parliament. Almost unheard of in modern times, ultra vires acts by the Crown or its servants were previously a major threat to the rule of law.\\nBoddington v British Transport Police is an example of an appeal heard by House of Lords that contested that a bylaw was beyond the powers conferred to it under section 67 of the Transport Act 1962.\\n\\n\\n== Administrative law ==\\nIn administrative law, an act may be judicially reviewable for ultra vires in a narrow or broad sense. Narrow ultra vires applies if an administrator did not have the substantive power to make a decision or it was wrought with procedural defects. Broad ultra vires applies if there is an abuse of power (e.g., Wednesbury unreasonableness or bad faith) or a failure to exercise an administrative discretion (e.g., acting at the behest of another or unlawfully applying a government policy) or application of discretionary powers in irrational and wrong way. Either doctrine may entitle a claimant to various prerogative writs, equitable remedies or statutory orders if they are satisfied.\\n\\n\\n=== United Kingdom ===\\nIn the seminal case of Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission, Lord Reid is accredited with formulating the doctrine of ultra vires. However, ultra vires, together with unreasonableness, was mentioned much earlier by Lord Russell in the well known case, Kruse v Johnson, regarding challenging by-laws and other rules. Anisminic is better known for not depriving courts of their jurisdiction to declare a decision a nullity, even if a statute expressly prevents the decision being subject to judicial review. Further cases such as Bromley LBC v Greater London Council and Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service have sought to refine the doctrine.\\nIn Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council v Hazell the House of Lords held that interest rate swaps entered into by local authorities (a popular method of circumventing statutory restrictions on local authorities borrowing money at that time) were all ultra vires and void, sparking a raft of satellite litigation.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nJudicial activism\\nJudicial Review in English Law\\nMark Elliott (St Catharine\\'s College, Cambridge proposes the modified ultra vires doctrine for administrative law, placing it firmly in the correct constitutional setting.

The current campus population of approximately 2,300 includes on-campus and online undergraduate and graduate students. The University grants certificates and degrees including bachelor, master, first-professional, and doctorate in the School of Arts, Science, and Business, the School of Health Sciences, and the Falk School of Sustainability.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nFounded as the Pennsylvania Female College on December 11, 1869, by Reverend William Trimble Beatty, Chatham was initially situated in the Berry mansion on Woodland Road off Fifth Avenue in the neighborhood of Shadyside. The campus today is composed of buildings and grounds from a number of former private mansions, including those of Andrew Mellon, Edward Stanton Fickes, George M. Laughlin Jr. and James Rea. It was renamed Pennsylvania College for Women in 1890, and as Chatham College in 1955. The name served to honor William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham and namesake of the City of Pittsburgh. The school gained university status from the Pennsylvania Department of Education on April 23, 2007, and publicly announced its new status on 2007-05-01, changing its name to Chatham University.\\nWith elements designed for the original Andrew Mellon estate by the renowned Olmsted Brothers, the 39-acre (16 ha) Chatham campus was designated an arboretum in 1998 by the American Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta. It features over 115 different varieties of species, including Japanese Flowering Crabapple, River Birch and Kentucky Coffee Tree. The Arboretum provides an outdoor classroom for students in the University\\u2019s Landscape Architecture and Landscape Studies programs, as well as an inviting place to stroll and to meditate.\\nIn 2005 the University expanded its programs to include online advanced degree programs (bachelors, masters, doctoral) through the School of Continuing Education, now the College for Continuing and Professional Studies. Two years later, Chatham\\'s M.F.A. Program in Creative Writing was named one of the top five Innovative/Unique Programs by The Atlantic Monthly.\\nChatham received some national attention in 2014 when it announced that it was engaging in a period of study \"considering admitting men for the first time in that college\\'s history,\" resulting in \"reactions of surprise and anger\" from its alumnae.\\n\\n\\n== Campuses ==\\nThe original Shadyside Campus is part of historic Woodland Road. The Shadyside Campus now includes Chatham Eastside, which serves as the home for health science and architecture programs.\\nThe University\\u2019s new 388-acre (157 ha) Eden Hall Campus is located north of the city in Richland Township, Pa. and will be the home of Chatham\\u2019s new Falk School of Sustainability. Programs at Eden Hall Campus include initiatives in sustainability and environmental studies, food studies, landscape architecture, and women\\u2019s studies. The Eden Hall Campus was donated to Chatham University by the Eden Hall Foundation on May 1, 2008. Currently the architectural team of Berkebile Nelson Immenschuh McDowell (BNIM) of Kansas City, Mo., which is partnering with landscape design firm Andropogon Associates of Philadelphia to lead the master planning process.\\n\\n\\n== Academics ==\\n\\nThe University structure includes three distinctive Colleges: Chatham College for Women houses academic and co-curricular programs for undergraduate women and embodies the traditions and rituals of the traditional women\\'s college. The College for Graduate Studies offers women and men both masters and doctoral programs. Programs within the College for Graduate Studies include concentrations in art and architecture, business, health sciences, teaching and creative writing. The College for Continuing and Professional Studies, formerly the School of Continuing Education, provides online and hybrid undergraduate and graduate degree programs for women and men, certificate programs, and community programming including the Summer Music and Arts Day Camp.\\n\\n\\n== Falk School of Sustainability ==\\nThe Falk School of Sustainability (FSS), founded June 2009, further expands the potential of the Eden Hall Campus and honors the legacy of Chatham\\'s 1929 alumna and founder of the modern environmental movement, Rachel Carson. The Falk School of Sustainability provides opportunities for the University\\u2019s students to earn undergraduate (Bachelor of Sustainability) and graduate (Master of Sustainability, Master of Arts in Food Studies, Executive Master of Sustainability Leadership) degrees. The first program the Falk School offered was the Master of Arts in Food Studies, which enrolled 30 students in its inaugural year. FSS will eventually be located at the University\\'s Eden Hall Campus.\\nIn fall 2010 the University selected David M. Hassenzahl, Ph.D. as the founding Dean of the School of Sustainability and the Environment. Dr. Hassenzahl is the coauthor of several books, including Should We Risk It?

Collier\\'s New Encyclopedia. 1921.', u'Banking': u'A bank is a financial intermediary and money creator that creates money by lending money to a borrower, thereby creating a corresponding deposit on the bank\\'s balance sheet. Lending activities can be performed directly by loaning or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial system and influence on national economies, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking, central banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.\\nBanking in its modern sense evolved in the 14th century in the rich cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had its roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties \\u2013 notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs and the Rothschilds \\u2013  have played a central role over many centuries. The oldest existing retail bank is Monte dei Paschi di Siena, while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe origins of modern banking can be traced to medieval and early Renaissance Italy, to the rich cities in the north like Florence, Lucca, Siena, Venice and Genoa. The Bardi and Peruzzi families dominated banking in 14th century Florence, establishing branches in many other parts of Europe. One of the most famous Italian banks was the Medici Bank, set up by Giovanni di Bicci de\\' Medici in 1397. The earliest known state deposit bank, Banco di San Giorgio (Bank of St. George), was founded in 1407 at Genoa, Italy.\\nModern banking practices, including fractional reserve banking and the issue of banknotes, emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries. Merchants started to store their gold with the goldsmiths of London, who possessed private vaults, and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee; these receipts could not be assigned, only the original depositor could collect the stored goods.\\n\\nGradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the depositor, which led to the development of modern banking practices; promissory notes (which evolved into banknotes) were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith. The goldsmith paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith\\'s customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of fractional reserve banking. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith\\'s promise to pay, allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default. Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit.\\nThe Bank of England was the first to begin the permanent issue of banknotes, in 1695. The Royal Bank of Scotland established the first overdraft facility in 1728. By the beginning of the 19th century a bankers\\' clearing house was established in London to allow multiple banks to clear transactions. The Rothschild\\'s pioneered international finance on a large scale, financing the purchase of the Suez canal for the British government.\\nThe oldest bank still in existence is Monte dei Paschi di Siena, headquartered in Siena, Italy, which has been operating continuously since 1472. It is followed by Berenberg Bank of Hamburg (1590) and Sveriges Riksbank of Sweden (1668).\\n\\n\\n=== Origin of the word ===\\nThe word bank was borrowed in Middle English from Middle French banque, from Old Italian banca, from Old High German banc, bank \"bench, counter\". Benches were used as desks or exchange counters during the Renaissance by Florentine bankers, who used to make their transactions atop desks covered by green tablecloths.\\nOne of the oldest items found showing money-changing activity is a silver Greek drachma coin from ancient Hellenic colony Trapezus on the Black Sea, modern Trabzon, c. 350\\u2013325 BC, presented in the British Museum in London. The coin shows a banker\\'s table (trapeza) laden with coins, a pun on the name of the city. In fact, even today in Modern Greek the word Trapeza (\\u03a4\\u03c1\\u03ac\\u03c0\\u03b5\\u03b6\\u03b1) means both a table (in formal language) and a bank (in everyday speech). [The everyday word used for \"table\" is trapezi (\"\\u03c4\\u03c1\\u03b1\\u03c0\\u03ad\\u03b6\\u03b9\"), a modern form of the archaic trapeza (\\u03c4\\u03c1\\u03ac\\u03c0\\u03b5\\u03b6\\u03b1)].\\n\\n\\n== Definition ==\\nThe definition of a bank varies from country to country. See the relevant country page (below) for more information.\\nUnder English common law, a banker is defined as a person who carries on the business of banking, which is specified as:\\nconducting current accounts for his customers,\\npaying cheques drawn on him/her, and\\ncollecting cheques for his/her customers.\\n\\nIn most common law jurisdictions there is a Bills of Exchange Act that codifies the law in relation to negotiable instruments, including cheques, and this Act contains a statutory definition of the term banker: banker includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not, who carry on the business of banking\\' (Section 2, Interpretation). Although this definition seems circular, it is actually functional, because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated.\\nThe business of banking is in many English common law countries not defined by statute but by common law, the definition above. In other English common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the business of banking or banking business. When looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation, and not necessarily in general. In particular, most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking. However, in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one. Examples of statutory definitions:\\n\"banking business\" means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account, paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers, the making of advances to customers, and includes such other business as the Authority may prescribe for the purposes of this Act; (Banking Act (Singapore), Section 2, Interpretation).\\n\"banking business\" means the business of either or both of the following:\\nreceiving from the general public money on current, deposit, savings or other similar account repayable on demand or within less than [3 months] ... or with a period of call or notice of less than that period;\\npaying or collecting checks drawn by or paid in by customers.\\nSince the advent of EFTPOS (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale), direct credit, direct debit and internet banking, the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument. This has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable customers to pay and be paid by third parties, even if they do not pay and collect checks.\\n\\n\\n== Banking ==\\n\\n\\n=== Standard activities ===\\n\\nBanks act as payment agents by conducting checking or current accounts for customers, paying cheques drawn by customers on the bank, and collecting cheques deposited to customers\\' current accounts. Banks also enable customer payments via other payment methods such as Automated Clearing House (ACH), Wire transfers or telegraphic transfer, EFTPOS, and automated teller machine (ATM).\\nBanks borrow money by accepting funds deposited on current accounts, by accepting term deposits, and by issuing debt securities such as banknotes and bonds. Banks lend money by making advances to customers on current accounts, by making installment loans, and by investing in marketable debt securities and other forms of money lending.\\nBanks provide different payment services, and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals. Non-banks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account.\\nBanks can create new money when they make a loan. New loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system. The money supply is usually increased by the act of lending, and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated. In the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2007, there was an increase in the money supply, largely caused by much more bank lending, which served to push up property prices and increase private debt. The amount of money in the economy as measured by M4 in the UK went from \\xa3750 billion to \\xa31700 billion between 1997 and 2007, much of the increase caused by bank lending. If all the banks increase their lending together, then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase. Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default, the banks then become more cautious, so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened in the UK and many other Western economies after 2007.\\n\\n\\n=== Range of activities ===\\nActivities undertaken by large banks include investment banking, corporate banking, private banking, insurance, consumer finance, foreign exchange trading, commodity trading, trading in equities, futures and options trading and money market trading.\\n\\n\\n=== Channels ===\\nBanks offer many different channels to access their banking and other services:\\nAutomated Teller Machines\\nA branch is a retail location\\nCall center\\nMail: most banks accept cheque deposits via mail and use mail to communicate to their customers, e.g. by sending out statements\\nMobile banking is a method of using one\\'s mobile phone to conduct banking transactions\\nOnline banking is a term used for performing multiple transactions, payments etc. over the Internet\\nRelationship Managers, mostly for private banking or business banking, often visiting customers at their homes or businesses\\nTelephone banking is a service which allows its customers to conduct transactions over the telephone with automated attendant or when requested with telephone operator\\nVideo banking is a term used for performing banking transactions or professional banking consultations via a remote video and audio connection. Video banking can be performed via purpose built banking transaction machines (similar to an Automated teller machine), or via a video conference enabled bank branch clarification\\nDSA is a Direct Selling Agent, who works for the bank based on a contract. Its main job is to increase the customer base for the bank.\\n\\n\\n=== Business model ===\\nA bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest, transaction fees and financial advice. The main method is via charging interest on the capital it lends out to customers. The bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds, and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities.\\nThis difference is referred to as the spread between the cost of funds and the loan interest rate. Historically, profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the economic cycle. Fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance.\\nIn the past 20 years American banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions.\\nFirst, this includes the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses. Merging banking, investment, and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for \"one-stop shopping\" by enabling cross-selling of products (which, the banks hope, will also increase profitability).\\nSecond, they have expanded the use of risk-based pricing from business lending to consumer lending, which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of default on loans. This helps to offset the losses from bad loans, lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories, and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit.\\nThird, they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients. These products include debit cards, prepaid cards, smart cards, and credit cards. They make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and smooth their consumption over time (in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems, it is still common to deal strictly in cash, including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home).\\nHowever, with convenience of easy credit, there is also increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt. Banks make money from card products through interest charges and fees charged to cardholders, and transaction fees to retailers who accept the bank\\'s credit and/or debit cards for payments.\\nThis helps in making profit and facilitates economic development as a whole.\\n\\n\\n=== Products ===\\n\\n\\n==== Retail banking ====\\nChecking account\\nSavings account\\nMoney market account\\nCertificate of deposit (CD)\\nIndividual retirement account (IRA)\\nCredit card\\nDebit card\\nMortgage\\nMutual fund\\nPersonal loan\\nTime deposits\\nATM card\\nCurrent Accounts\\nCheque books\\n\\n\\n==== Business (or commercial/investment) banking ====\\nBusiness loan\\nCapital raising (Equity / Debt / Hybrids)\\nMezzanine finance\\nProject finance\\nRevolving credit\\nRisk management (FX, interest rates, commodities, derivatives)\\nTerm loan\\nCash Management Services (Lock box, Remote Deposit Capture, Merchant Processing)\\ncredit services\\n\\n\\n== Capital and risk ==\\nBanks face a number of risks in order to conduct their business, and how well these risks are managed and understood is a key driver behind profitability, and how much capital a bank is required to hold. Bank capital consists principally of equity, retained earnings and subordinated debt.\\nSome of the main risks faced by banks include:\\nCredit risk: risk of loss arising from a borrower who does not make payments as promised.\\nLiquidity risk: risk that a given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss (or make the required profit).\\nMarket risk: risk that the value of a portfolio, either an investment portfolio or a trading portfolio, will decrease due to the change in value of the market risk factors.\\nOperational risk: risk arising from execution of a company\\'s business functions.\\nReputational risk: a type of risk related to the trustworthiness of business.\\nMacroeconomic risk: risks related to the aggregate economy the bank is operating in.\\nThe capital requirement is a bank regulation, which sets a framework within which a bank or depository institution must manage its balance sheet. The categorization of assets and capital is highly standardized so that it can be risk weighted.\\n\\n\\n== Banks in the economy ==\\n\\n\\n=== Economic functions ===\\nThe economic functions of banks include:\\nIssue of money, in the form of banknotes and current accounts subject to check or payment at the customer\\'s order. These claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand, and hence valued at par. They are effectively transferable by mere delivery, in the case of banknotes, or by drawing a check that the payee may bank or cash.\\nNetting and settlement of payments \\u2013 banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers, participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect, present, be presented with, and pay payment instruments. This enables banks to economize on reserves held for settlement of payments, since inward and outward payments offset each other. It also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas, reducing the cost of settlement between them.\\nCredit intermediation \\u2013 banks borrow and lend back-to-back on their own account as middle men.\\nCredit quality improvement \\u2013 banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers (ordinary credit quality), but are high quality borrowers. The improvement comes from diversification of the bank\\'s assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations. However, banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured; if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security, to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate, this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position.\\nAsset liability mismatch/Maturity transformation \\u2013 banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt, but provide more long term loans. In other words, they borrow short and lend long. With a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers, banks can do this by aggregating issues (e.g. accepting deposits and issuing banknotes) and redemptions (e.g. withdrawals and redemption of banknotes), maintaining reserves of cash, investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed, and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources (e.g. wholesale cash markets and securities markets).\\nMoney creation \\u2013 whenever a bank gives out a loan in a fractional-reserve banking system, a new sum of virtual money is created.\\n\\n\\n=== Bank crisis ===\\nBanks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises. These include liquidity risk (where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds), credit risk (the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it), and interest rate risk (the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable, if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans).\\nBanking crises have developed many times throughout history, when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole. Prominent examples include the bank run that occurred during the Great Depression, the U.S. Savings and Loan crisis in the 1980s and early 1990s, the Japanese banking crisis during the 1990s, and the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the 2000s.\\n\\n\\n=== Size of global banking industry ===\\n\\nAssets of the largest 1,000 banks in the world grew by 6.8% in the 2008/2009 financial year to a record US$96.4 trillion while profits declined by 85% to US$115 billion. Growth in assets in adverse market conditions was largely a result of recapitalization. EU banks held the largest share of the total, 56% in 2008/2009, down from 61% in the previous year. Asian banks\\' share increased from 12% to 14% during the year, while the share of US banks increased from 11% to 13%. Fee revenue generated by global investment banking totaled US$66.3 billion in 2009, up 12% on the previous year.\\nThe United States has the most banks in the world in terms of institutions (7,085 at the end of 2008) and possibly branches (82,000). This is an indicator of the geography and regulatory structure of the USA, resulting in a large number of small to medium-sized institutions in its banking system. As of Nov 2009, China\\'s top 4 banks have in excess of 67,000 branches (ICBC:18000+, BOC:12000+, CCB:13000+, ABC:24000+) with an additional 140 smaller banks with an undetermined number of branches. Japan had 129 banks and 12,000 branches. In 2004, Germany, France, and Italy each had more than 30,000 branches\\u2014more than double the 15,000 branches in the UK.\\n\\n\\n== Regulation ==\\n\\nCurrently commercial banks are regulated in most jurisdictions by government entities and require a special bank license to operate.\\nUsually the definition of the business of banking for the purposes of regulation is extended to include acceptance of deposits, even if they are not repayable to the customer\\'s order\\u2014although money lending, by itself, is generally not included in the definition.\\nUnlike most other regulated industries, the regulator is typically also a participant in the market, being either a publicly or privately governed central bank. Central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of issuing banknotes. However, in some countries this is not the case. In the UK, for example, the Financial Services Authority licenses banks, and some commercial banks (such as the Bank of Scotland) issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the Bank of England, the UK government\\'s central bank.\\nBanking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the bank (defined above) and the customer\\u2014defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account.\\nThe law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows:\\nThe bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer: when the account is in credit, the bank owes the balance to the customer; when the account is overdrawn, the customer owes the balance to the bank.\\nThe bank agrees to pay the customer\\'s checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customer\\'s account, plus any agreed overdraft limit.\\nThe bank may not pay from the customer\\'s account without a mandate from the customer, e.g. a check drawn by the customer.\\nThe bank agrees to promptly collect the checks deposited to the customer\\'s account as the customer\\'s agent, and to credit the proceeds to the customer\\'s account.\\nThe bank has a right to combine the customer\\'s accounts, since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship.\\nThe bank has a lien on checks deposited to the customer\\'s account, to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank.\\nThe bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customer\\'s account\\u2014unless the customer consents, there is a public duty to disclose, the bank\\'s interests require it, or the law demands it.\\nThe bank must not close a customer\\'s account without reasonable notice, since checks are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days.\\nThese implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank. The statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms and/or create new rights, obligations or limitations relevant to the bank-customer relationship.\\nSome types of financial institution, such as building societies and credit unions, may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements, and therefore regulated under separate rules.\\nThe requirements for the issue of a bank license vary between jurisdictions but typically include:\\nMinimum capital\\nMinimum capital ratio\\n\\'Fit and Proper\\' requirements for the bank\\'s controllers, owners, directors, or senior officers\\nApproval of the bank\\'s business plan as being sufficiently prudent and plausible.\\n\\n\\n== Types of banks ==\\nBanks\\' activities can be divided into:\\nretail banking, dealing directly with individuals and small businesses;\\nbusiness banking, providing services to mid-market business;\\ncorporate banking, directed at large business entities;\\nprivate banking, providing wealth management services to high-net-worth individuals and families;\\ninvestment banking, relating to activities on the financial markets.\\nMost banks are profit-making, private enterprises. However, some are owned by government, or are non-profit organizations.\\n\\n\\n=== Types of banks ===\\n\\nCommercial banks: the term used for a normal bank to distinguish it from an investment bank. After the Great Depression, the U.S. Congress required that banks only engage in banking activities, whereas investment banks were limited to capital market activities. Since the two no longer have to be under separate ownership, some use the term \"commercial bank\" to refer to a bank or a division of a bank that mostly deals with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses.\\nCommunity banks: locally operated financial institutions that empower employees to make local decisions to serve their customers and the partners.\\nCommunity development banks: regulated banks that provide financial services and credit to under-served markets or populations.\\nLand development banks: The special banks providing Long Term Loans are called Land Development Banks, in the short, LDB. The history of LDB is quite old. The first LDB was started at Jhang in Punjab in 1920. The main objective of the LDBs are to promote the development of land, agriculture and increase the agricultural production. The LDBs provide long-term finance to members directly through their branches.\\nCredit unions or Co-operative Banks: not-for-profit cooperatives owned by the depositors and often offering rates more favorable than for-profit banks. Typically, membership is restricted to employees of a particular company, residents of a defined area, members of a certain union or religious organizations, and their immediate families.\\nPostal savings banks: savings banks associated with national postal systems.\\nPrivate banks: banks that manage the assets of high-net-worth individuals. Historically a minimum of USD 1 million was required to open an account, however, over the last years many private banks have lowered their entry hurdles to USD 250,000 for private investors.\\nOffshore banks: banks located in jurisdictions with low taxation and regulation. Many offshore banks are essentially private banks.\\nSavings bank: in Europe, savings banks took their roots in the 19th or sometimes even in the 18th century. Their original objective was to provide easily accessible savings products to all strata of the population. In some countries, savings banks were created on public initiative; in others, socially committed individuals created foundations to put in place the necessary infrastructure. Nowadays, European savings banks have kept their focus on retail banking: payments, savings products, credits and insurances for individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises. Apart from this retail focus, they also differ from commercial banks by their broadly decentralized distribution network, providing local and regional outreach\\u2014and by their socially responsible approach to business and society.\\nBuilding societies and Landesbanks: institutions that conduct retail banking.\\nEthical banks: banks that prioritize the transparency of all operations and make only what they consider to be socially responsible investments.\\nA Direct or Internet-Only bank is a banking operation without any physical bank branches, conceived and implemented wholly with networked computers.\\n\\n\\n=== Types of investment banks ===\\nInvestment banks \"underwrite\" (guarantee the sale of) stock and bond issues, trade for their own accounts, make markets, provide investment management, and advise corporations on capital market activities such as mergers and acquisitions.\\nMerchant banks were traditionally banks which engaged in trade finance. The modern definition, however, refers to banks which provide capital to firms in the form of shares rather than loans. Unlike venture caps, they tend not to invest in new companies.\\n\\n\\n=== Both combined ===\\nUniversal banks, more commonly known as financial services companies, engage in several of these activities. These big banks are very diversified groups that, among other services, also distribute insurance\\u2014 hence the term bancassurance, a portmanteau word combining \"banque or bank\" and \"assurance\", signifying that both banking and insurance are provided by the same corporate entity.\\n\\n\\n=== Other types of banks ===\\nCentral banks are normally government-owned and charged with quasi-regulatory responsibilities, such as supervising commercial banks, or controlling the cash interest rate. They generally provide liquidity to the banking system and act as the lender of last resort in event of a crisis.\\nIslamic banks adhere to the concepts of Islamic law. This form of banking revolves around several well-established principles based on Islamic canons. All banking activities must avoid interest, a concept that is forbidden in Islam. Instead, the bank earns profit (markup) and fees on the financing facilities that it extends to customers.\\n\\n\\n== Challenges within the banking industry ==\\n\\n\\n=== United States ===\\n\\nThe United States banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated in the world, with multiple specialized and focused regulators. All banks with FDIC-insured deposits have the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as a regulator. However, for soundness examinations (i.e., whether a bank is operating in a sound manner), the Federal Reserve is the primary federal regulator for Fed-member state banks; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is the primary federal regulator for national banks; and the Office of Thrift Supervision, or OTS, is the primary federal regulator for thrifts. State non-member banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the FDIC. National banks have one primary regulator\\u2014the OCC. Qualified Intermediaries & Exchange Accommodators are regulated by MAIC.\\nEach regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere.\\nThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) was established in 1979 as a formal inter-agency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions. Although the FFIEC has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies, the rules and regulations are constantly changing.\\nIn addition to changing regulations, changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, MAIC and OCC. Offices have been closed, supervisory regions have been merged, staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut. The remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator. While banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment, regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks. The impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands-on assessment by the regulators, less time spent with each institution, and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks, potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the United States.\\nThe changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans, rate competition for deposits and the general market changes, industry trends and economic fluctuations. It has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market. A rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions, but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders.\\nThe management of the banks\\u2019 asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today\\u2019s economic environment. Loans are a bank\\u2019s primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect, the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core. While always an issue for banks, declining asset quality has become a big problem for financial institutions. There are several reasons for this, one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of \\u201cgood times.\\u201d The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management. Problems are more likely to go undetected, resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered. In addition, banks, like any business, struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses, such as adequate employee training programs.\\nBanks also face a host of other challenges such as aging ownership groups. Across the country, many banks\\u2019 management teams and board of directors are aging. Banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders, both public and private, to achieve earnings and growth projections. Regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk. Banking is also an extremely competitive industry. Competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies, credit unions, check cashing services, credit card companies, etc.\\nAs a reaction, banks have developed their activities in financial instruments, through financial market operations such as brokerage and MAIC trust & Securities Clearing services trading and become big players in such activities.\\n\\n\\n=== Loan activities of banks ===\\nTo be able to provide home buyers and builders with the funds needed, banks must compete for deposits. The phenomenon of disintermediation had to dollars moving from savings accounts and into direct market instruments such as U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, agency securities, and corporate debt. One of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits.\\nTo compete for deposits, US savings institutions offer many different types of plans:\\nPassbook or ordinary deposit accounts \\u2014 permit any amount to be added to or withdrawn from the account at any time.\\nNOW and Super NOW accounts \\u2014 function like checking accounts but earn interest. A minimum balance may be required on Super NOW accounts.\\nMoney market accounts \\u2014 carry a monthly limit of preauthorized transfers to other accounts or persons and may require a minimum or average balance.\\nCertificate accounts \\u2014 subject to loss of some or all interest on withdrawals before maturity.\\nNotice accounts \\u2014 the equivalent of certificate accounts with an indefinite term. Savers agree to notify the institution a specified time before withdrawal.\\nIndividual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Keogh plans \\u2014 a form of retirement savings in which the funds deposited and interest earned are exempt from income tax until after withdrawal.\\nChecking accounts \\u2014 offered by some institutions under definite restrictions.\\nAll withdrawals and deposits are completely the sole decision and responsibility of the account owner unless the parent or guardian is required to do otherwise for legal reasons.\\nClub accounts and other savings accounts \\u2014 designed to help people save regularly to meet certain goals.\\n\\n\\n== Accounting for bank accounts ==\\n\\nBank statements are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting standards of the world. Under GAAP and MAIC there are two kinds of accounts: debit and credit. Credit accounts are Revenue, Equity and Liabilities. Debit Accounts are Assets and Expenses. The bank credits a credit account to increase its balance, and debits a credit account to decrease its balance.\\nThe customer debits his or her savings/bank (asset) account in his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If the customer is overdrawn, he will have a negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement.\\n\\n\\n=== Brokered deposits ===\\nOne source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on the behalf of investors through MAIC or other trust corporations. This money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favorable terms, often better than those offered local depositors. It is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all, all funds being brokered deposits. Accepting a significant quantity of such deposits, or \"hot money\" as it is sometimes called, puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position, as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits. This may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank. Banks which failed during 2008 and 2009 in the United States during the global financial crisis had, on average, four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank. Such deposits, combined with risky real estate investments, factored into the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. MAIC Regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits.\\n\\n\\n== Globalization in the Banking Industry ==\\nIn modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry. Increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies, such as Bloomberg, have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world, since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk. The growth in cross-border activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities. However, despite these reductions in barriers and growth in cross-border activities, the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries. In the USA, for instance, very few banks even worry about the Riegle-Neal Act, which promotes more efficient interstate banking. In the vast majority of nations around globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation. One reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals. On the other hand for large corporations, it is not as important in what nation the bank is in, since the corporation\\'s financial information is available around the globe.

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Washington, D.C. Provides an overview of the national banking system of the USA, its regulation, and the OCC.', u'Limited liability partnership': u'A limited liability partnership (LLP) is a partnership in which some or all partners (depending on the jurisdiction) have limited liabilities. It therefore exhibits elements of partnerships and corporations. In an LLP, one partner is not responsible or liable for another partner\\'s misconduct or negligence. This is an important difference from the traditional unlimited partnership under the Partnership Act 1890, in which each partner has joint and several liability. In an LLP, some partners have a form of limited liability similar to that of the shareholders of a corporation. In some countries, an LLP must also have at least one thing called as a \"general partner\" with unlimited liability. Unlike corporate shareholders, the partners have the right to manage the business directly. In contrast, corporate shareholders have to elect a board of directors under the laws of various state charters. The board organizes itself (also under the laws of the various state charters) and hires corporate officers who then have as \"corporate\" individuals the legal responsibility to manage the corporation in the corporation\\'s best interest. An LLP also contains a different level of tax liability from that of a corporation.\\nLimited liability partnerships are distinct from limited partnerships in some countries, which may allow all LLP partners to have limited liability, while a limited partnership may require at least one unlimited partner and allow others to assume the role of a passive and limited liability investor. As a result, in these countries, the LLP is more suited for businesses in which all investors wish to take an active role in management.\\nThere is considerable confusion between LLPs as constituted in the U.S. and those introduced in the UK in 2001 and adopted elsewhere \\u2014 see below \\u2014 as the UK LLP is, despite its name, specifically legislated as a corporate body rather than as a partnership.\\n\\n\\n== National variations ==\\nFor a fuller country-by-country listing of types of partnerships and companies, see Types of business entity.\\n\\n\\n=== Canada ===\\nAll provinces, except Yukon, Prince Edward Island and Nunavut, have permitted LLPs for lawyers and accountants. In British Columbia, the Partnership Amendment Act, 2004 (Bill 35) permitted LLPs for lawyers and other professionals as well as businesses.\\n\\n\\n=== China ===\\nIn China, the LLP is known as a Special general partnership (\\u7279\\u6b8a\\u666e\\u901a\\u5408\\u4f19). The organizational form is restricted to knowledge-based professions and technical service industries. The structure shields co-partners from liabilities due to the willful misconduct or gross negligence of one partner or a group of partners.\\n\\n\\n=== Germany ===\\nThe German Partnerschaftsgesellschaft or PartG is an association of non-commercial professionals, working together. Though not a corporate entity, it can sue and be sued, own property and act under the partnership\\'s name. The partners, however, are jointly and severally liable for all the partnership\\'s debts, except when only some partners\\' misconduct caused damages to another party \\u2014 and then only if professional liability insurance is mandatory. The Partnerschaftsgesellschaft is not subject to corporate or business tax, only its partners\\' respective income is taxed.\\n\\n\\n=== Greece ===\\nAn LLP is an approximate equivalent to the Greek \\u0395\\u03a0\\u0395 (\\u0395\\u03c4\\u03b1\\u03b9\\u03c1\\u03b5\\u03af\\u03b1 \\u03a0\\u03b5\\u03c1\\u03b9\\u03bf\\u03c1\\u03b9\\u03c3\\u03bc\\u03ad\\u03bd\\u03b7\\u03c2 \\u0395\\u03c5\\u03b8\\u03cd\\u03bd\\u03b7\\u03c2 Eter\\xeda Periorism\\xe9nis Evth\\xednis Company of Limited Liability). In an \\u0395\\u03a0\\u0395 the partners own personal shares that can be sold by a partner only when all other partners agree. The business management can be exercised either directly by the board of partners or by a General Manager. In the aspect of liability, an \\u0395\\u03a0\\u0395 is identical to an LLP.\\n\\n\\n=== India ===\\nThe Limited Liability Partnership Act 2008 was published in the official Gazette of India on January 9, 2009 and has been notified with effect from 31 March 2009. However, the Act, has been notified with limited sections only. The rules have been notified in the official gazette on April 1, 2009. The first LLP was incorporated in the first week of April 2009.\\n1. In India, for all purposes of taxation, an LLP is treated like any other partnership firm.\\n2. be limited to their agreed contribution in the LLP..\\n3. Further, no partner would be liable on account of the independent or unauthorized actions of other partners, thus allowing individual partners to be shielded from joint liability created by another partner\\'s wrongful business decisions or misconduct.\\n4. LLP shall be a body corporate and a legal entity separate from its partners. It will have perpetual succession. Indian Partnership Act, 1932 shall not be applicable to LLPs and there shall not be any upper limit on number of partners in an LLP unlike an ordinary partnership firm where the maximum number of partners can not exceed 20, LLP Act makes a mandatory statement where one of the partner to the LLP should be an Indian.\\n5. Provisions have been made for corporate actions like mergers, amalgamations etc.\\n6. While enabling provisions in respect of winding up and dissolutions of LLPs have been made, detailed provisions in this regard would be provided by way of rules under the Act.\\n7. The Act also provide LP.\\n9. The Registrar of Companies (Roc) shall register and control LLPs also.\\n10. The governance of LLPs shall .\\n\\n\\n=== Japan ===\\nLimited liability partnerships (\\u6709\\u9650\\u8cac\\u4efb\\u4e8b\\u696d\\u7d44\\u5408, y\\u016bgen sekinin jigy\\u014d kumiai) were introduced to Japan in 2006 during a large-scale revamp of the country\\'s laws governing business organizations. Japanese LLPs may be formed for any purpose (although The purpose must be clearly stated in the partnership agreement and cannot be general), have full limited liability and are treated as pass-through entities for tax purposes. However, each partner in an LLP must take an active role in the business, so the model is more suitable for joint ventures and small businesses than for companies in which investors plan to take passive roles. Japanese LLPs may not be used by lawyers or accountants, as these professions are required to do business through an unlimited liability entity.\\nA Japanese LLP is not a corporation, but rather exists as a contractual relationship between the partners, similarly to an American LLP. Japan also has a type of corporation with a partnership-styled internal structure, called a godo kaisha, which is closer in form to a British LLP or American limited liability company.\\n\\n\\n=== Kazakhstan ===\\nThe concept of LLP exists in Kazakhstan law. All partners in a Kazakhstan LLP have limited liability, and they are liable for the debts of the partnership to the extent of the value of their corresponding participatory interests in the partnership. The names for LLP in Kazakhstan are \"\\u0416\\u0428\\u0421\" (which stands for \\u0416\\u0430\\u0443\\u0430\\u043f\\u043a\\u0435\\u0440\\u0448\\u0456\\u043b\\u0456\\u0433\\u0456 \\u0448\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0435\\u0443\\u043b\\u0456 \\u0441\\u0435\\u0440\\u0456\\u043a\\u0442\\u0435\\u0441\\u0442\\u0456\\u043a Zha\\u016bapkershiliri shekte\\u016bli seriktestik) in Kazakh and \"\\u0422\\u041e\\u041e\" (which stands for \\u0422\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u0440\\u0438\\u0449\\u0435\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u043e \\u0441 \\u043e\\u0433\\u0440\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0439 \\u043e\\u0442\\u0432\\u0435\\u0442\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u044c\\u044e Tovarishchestvo s ogranichennoy otvyetstvyennost\\u02bcyu) in Russian. This is the most popular business form in Kazakhstan. Almost any private business may be incorporated as an LLP (notable exceptions are banks, airlines, insurance companies, and mortgage companies, which must be incorporated in the form of a joint stock company). An LLP in Kazakhstan is a corporate body, and in fact, is an LLC. Partners cannot conduct business on its own, and it\\'s the corporate body that conducts the business. There is also a concept of \"simple partnership\" in Kazakhstan law, which corresponds more to the general concept of partnership, but it is not widely used and is not well developed in Kazakhstan.\\n\\n\\n=== Poland ===\\nA close equivalent to limited liability partnerships under Polish law is the sp\\xf3\\u0142ka partnerska, where all partners are jointly and severely liable for partnership\\'s debts apart from those arising from another partner\\'s misconduct or negligence. This partnership type is only addressed to representatives of some \"high risk\" occupations, such as lawyers, medicine doctors, tax advisers, accountants, brokers, sworn translators etc.\\n\\n\\n=== Romania ===\\nAn LLP is equivalent to the Romanian law vehicle known as a Societate civil\\u0103 profesional\\u0103 cu r\\u0103spundere limitat\\u0103.\\n\\n\\n=== Singapore ===\\nLLPs are formed under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2005. This legislation draws on both the US and UK models of LLP, and like the latter establishes the LLP as a body corporate. However for tax purposes it is treated like a general partnership, so that the partners rather than the partnership are subject to tax (tax transparency).\\n\\n\\n=== United Kingdom ===\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom LLPs are governed by the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 (in Great Britain) and the Limited Liability Partnerships Act (Northern Ireland) 2002 in Northern Ireland. A UK limited liability partnership is a corporate body - that is to say, it has a continuing legal existence independent of its members, as compared to a Partnership which may (in England and Wales, does not) have a legal existence dependent upon its membership.\\nA UK LLP\\'s members have a collective (\"Joint\") responsibility, to the extent that they may agree in an \"LLP agreement\", but no individual (\"several\") responsibility for each other\\'s actions. As with a limited company or a corporation, members in an LLP cannot, in the absence of fraud or wrongful trading, lose more than they invest.\\nIn relation to tax, however, a UK LLP is similar to a partnership, namely, it is tax-transparent, that is to say it pays no UK corporation tax or capital gains tax. Instead, LLP income and/or gains are distributed gross to partners as self-employed persons, rather than as PAYE employees. Partners receiving income and/or gains from an LLP are liable for their own taxation.\\nIt is a unique entity in its synthesis of collective and individual rights and responsibilities and its flexibility \\u2014 there is in fact no requirement for the LLP agreement even to be in writing because simple partnership-based regulations apply by way of default provisions.\\nIt has to date been closely replicated by Japan \\u2014 see above \\u2014 and by the financial centres of Dubai and Qatar. It is perhaps closest in nature to a limited liability company in the United States of America although it may be distinguished from that entity by the fact that the LLC, while having a legal existence independent of its members is not technically a corporate body because its legal existence is time limited and therefore not \"continuing.\"\\nThe LLP structure is commonly used by accountants to retain the tax structure of traditional partnerships whilst adding some limited liability protection. LLPs are also becoming more common among firms in the legal profession such as solicitors and patent attorneys that by law are prohibited from incorporating as companies. LLPs are also \\'popular with money-launderers because they are opaque and\\u2014whether by design or accident\\u2014can easily slip under the radar of tax authorities\\'.\\nMore information is available on the official Companies House website.\\n\\n\\n=== United States ===\\nIn the United States, each individual state has its own law governing their formation. Limited liability partnerships emerged in the early 1990s: while only two states allowed LLPs in 1992, over forty had adopted LLP statutes by the time LLPs were added to the Uniform Partnership Act in 1996.\\nThe limited liability partnership was formed in the aftermath of the collapse of real estate and energy prices in Texas in the 1980s. This collapse led to a large wave of bank and savings and loan failures. Because the amounts recoverable from the banks were small, efforts were made to recover assets from the lawyers and accountants that had advised the banks in the early 1980s. The reason was that partners in law and accounting firms were subject to the possibility of huge claims which would bankrupt them personally, and the first LLP laws were passed to shield innocent members of these partnerships from liability.\\nAlthough found in many business fields, the LLP is an especially popular form of organization among professionals, particularly lawyers, accountants, and architects. In some U.S. states, namely California, New York, Oregon, and Nevada, LLPs can only be formed for such professional uses. Formation of an LLP typically requires filing certificates with the county and state offices. Although specific rules vary from state to state, all states have passed variations of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act.\\nThe liability of the partners varies from state to state. Section 306(c) of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (1997)(RUPA) (a standard statute adopted by a majority of the states) grants LLPs a form of limited liability similar to that of a corporation:\\n\\nAn obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a limited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the partnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a partner.\\n\\nHowever, a sizable minority of states only extend such protection against negligence claims, meaning that partners in an LLP can be personally liable for contract and intentional tort claims brought against the LLP. While Tennessee and West Virginia have otherwise adopted RUPA, their respective adoptions of Section 306 depart from the uniform language, and only a partial liability shield is provided.\\nAs in a partnership or limited liability company (LLC), the profits of an LLP are allocated among the partners for tax purposes, avoiding the problem of \"double taxation\" often found in corporations.\\nSome US states have combined the LP and LLP forms to create limited liability limited partnerships.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nProfessional corporation\\nLimited liability company\\nSoci\\xe9t\\xe9 \\xe0 Responsibilit\\xe9 Limit\\xe9e (SARL) for Francophone countries.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\"Limited Partnerships & Limited Liability Partnerships: The Basics\", by Peri H.

Archived 11/7/09\", u'7d (New York City Subway service)': u'The 7 Flushing Local and <7> Flushing Express are two rapid transit services in the A Division of the New York City Subway, providing local and express services along the full length of the IRT Flushing Line. The logo is colored raspberry on station signs, route signs, and the official subway map, with local service denoted by a (7) (within a circular bullet) and express service by a <7> (within a diamond-shaped bullet). Both services operate between Main Street in Flushing, Queens and Times Square in Midtown Manhattan.\\nLocal service operates at all times. Express service runs only during rush hours and early evenings in the peak direction. \"Super Express\" service to Manhattan is also provided after New York Mets games weeknights and weekends at Citi Field and US Open (tennis) games: starting at Mets \\u2013 Willets Point and operating express to Times Square, also bypassing Junction Boulevard, Hunters Point Avenue and Vernon Boulevard \\u2013 Jackson Avenue.\\nThe 7 is nicknamed the \"International Express,\" in part because it travels through several different ethnic neighborhoods populated by U.S. immigrants, especially along Roosevelt Avenue, and in part because it was the principal line that served the 1964-65 New York World\\'s Fair. This name is not official, nor is the title used in day-to-day operations.\\n\\n\\n== Service history ==\\nOn June 13, 1915, the first test train on the IRT Flushing Line ran between Grand Central and Vernon Boulevard \\u2013 Jackson Avenue, followed by the start of revenue service on June 22. Over the next thirteen years, the line was extended piece by piece to its current form between Times Square and Flushing \\u2013 Main Street.\\nThe 7 designation has been assigned to its current route since the introduction of front rollsigns on the R12 in 1948.\\nFrom May 13, 1985 to August 21, 1989, the IRT Flushing Line was overhauled for improvements, including the installation of new track, repair of station structures and to improve line infrastructure. The major element was the replacement of rails on the Queens Boulevard viaduct. Express service was suspended for the duration of the project; however, extra service was provided for Mets games and Flushing Meadows Park events. Upon the completion of the project, express service was restored, but express trains bypassed 61st Street \\u2013 Woodside because the Transit Authority was concerned about passengers transferring between local and express trains at that station. The stop was added a few months later after pressure from community opposition.\\nIn the mid-1990s, the MTA discovered that the Queens Boulevard viaduct structure was unstable, as rocks that were used to support the tracks as ballast became loose due to poor drainage, which, in turn, affected the integrity of the concrete structure overall. Express service was suspended between 61st Street \\u2013 Woodside and Queensboro Plaza; temporary platforms were installed to access the express track in the four intermediate stations. The work began in April 1993. When the viaduct reconstruction finished on March 31, 1997, full express service was reinstated.\\nIn 1999, express service was expanded from rush hours only to weekdays from 6:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. However, this expansion was cut back in 2009 due to frequent midday construction.\\nWork has been underway since 2008 to convert the 7 service to accommodate CBTC. Expected to cost $585.9 million, CBTC will allow two additional trains per hour as well as two additional trains for the 7 Subway Extension, providing a 7% increase in capacity. (Currently, service on the 7 is limited to 27 trains per hour (tph) as a result of the bumper blocks at Times Square. A new terminal at 34th Street has tail tracks to store rush-hour trains and will increase the service frequency to 29 tph.) New cars on order for the A Division (the R188 contract) are compatible with CBTC. Installation of CBTC and delivery of the trains will both be completed in 2016.\\nThe 7 Subway Extension, which travels west and south to 34th Street and 11th Avenue, near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Hudson Yards, is currently under construction and is scheduled to be completed in late summer or early fall 2014, but will not be opened by November 2014. Before the opening was pushed back three times, it was scheduled to open in December 2013. The 34th Street station\\'s construction project itself will not be completed until the end of 2015.\\nOn November 16, 2010, New York City officials announced they are considering a further extension of the service across the Hudson River to the Secaucus Junction train station in New Jersey. As of October 26, 2011 tentative support for the extension has been given by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg as well as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in comments to the press. However, in April 2013, MTA former chairman Joseph Lhota announced that the 7 train would not be extended to New Jersey due to the high costs of the project, which included constructing a subway yard and a subway tunnel in New Jersey. Instead, Lhota put his support behind Amtrak\\u2019s Gateway Tunnel project which entails a new tunnel to Manhattan for Amtrak and NJ Transit trains.\\n\\n\\n== Fleet ==\\nThe 7 operates with 11-car sets; the number of cars in a single 7 train set is more than in any other New York City Subway service. These trains are not the longest in the system, since a train of 11 \"A\" Division cars is only 565 feet (172 m) long, while a standard B Division train, which consists of ten 60-foot cars or eight 75-foot cars, is 600 feet (180 m) long.\\n\\n\\n=== Fleet history ===\\nThe Steinway Low-V was built between 1915 and 1925 specifically for use on the current 7 train. They had special gear ratios to climb the steep grades (4.5%) in the Steinway Tunnels, something standard Interborough equipment could not do.\\nIn 1938, an order of all-new World\\'s Fair cars was placed with the St. Louis Car Company. These cars broke from IRT \"tradition\" in that they did not have vestibules at each car end. In addition, because the IRT was bankrupt at the time, the cars were built as single ended cars, with train controls for the motorman on one side and door controls for the conductor on the other. These cars spent their last days on the elevated IRT Third Avenue Line in The Bronx.\\nIn 1964, the picture window R33/R36 World\\'s Fair cars replaced the older R12s, R14s, R15s, and some R17s in time for the 1964 New York World\\'s Fair. The 7 was the last stronghold for the \"Redbird\" cars. Until December 2001, the entire fleet was dominated by the R33/R36 WF \"Bluebird\" cars. In 2001, with the arrival of the R142/R142A cars, the Transit Authority announced the retirement of all Redbird cars. From January 2002 to November 2003, the Bombardier-built R62A cars formerly used on the 3 and 6 trains gradually replaced all of the R33/36 WF cars on the 7. On November 3, 2003, the last Redbird train made its final trip on this route, making all stops between Times Square and the then-named Willets Point \\u2013 Shea Stadium. Several Redbird cars running on this service were decorated with Mets logos and colors during the 2000 Subway Series against the New York Yankees, as the Flushing Line runs adjacent to Citi Field and the former location of Shea Stadium. Some R33/R36 WFs remain in Corona Yard, adjacent to Flushing Meadows Corona Park and Citi Field.\\nCurrently, all of the R62As on the 7, which were all delivered to the 7 service by 2003, have been upgraded with LED lighted signs to distinguish between express and local trains. These signs are located on the rollsigns that are found on the side of each car. The local is a green circle around the 7 service bullet while the express is a red diamond. Previously, the rollsigns showed either a 7 (within a circle) or a <7> (within a diamond) with the word \"Express\" underneath it. They will be replaced by R188 subway cars through 2016, and the displaced R62As are currently running on the 6 service.\\nBy 2016, R188 cars equipped with communications-based train control (CBTC) will run on the 7, outfitted for the automation equipment for the Flushing Line. The first train of R188 cars began operating in passenger service on November 9, 2013. In addition to providing six extra 11-car trains for the 7 Subway Extension, the R188s will allow twenty R62A expansion cars to be freed up for the other seven IRT services.\\n\\n\\n=== Gallery ===\\n\\n\\n== Route ==\\n\\n\\n=== Service pattern ===\\nThe following table shows the line used by the 7 and <7> trains, with shaded boxes indicating the route at the specified times:\\n\\n\\n=== Stations ===\\nFor a more detailed station listing, see IRT Flushing Line.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nMTA New York City Transit \\u2013 7 Flushing Local\\nMTA New York City Transit \\u2013 7 Flushing Express\\n\"7 Subway Timetable, Effective December 7, 2014\".

From 1902 until 1908, the company produced the Brennan automobile however, after the demise of the automobile enterprise, the company again turned their focus to automobile engines and later marine engines. They were in business for 75 years when the company closed its doors in 1972.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe company was founded in 1897 by Patrick H. Brennan (1865 - January 22, 1934) and was known as Brennan Motor Manufacturing Company or Brennan Motor Company. The company motto was \"Simplicity and durability.\"\\nBrennan was first engaged in the manufacture of bicycles before turning to construction of automobiles. Eldest son, Emmett A. Brennan (born 1890), took control of the company in 1934 when his father died and was president of the establishment until July 1972, when he retired.\\n\\n\\n=== Automobile production ===\\n\\nFor a brief period from 1902 until 1908, the company produced the Brennan automobile. The firm would take up auto manufacturing \"occasionally, perhaps when demand was slow.\" The auto was similar to what was a \"fairly standard American pattern\" with the power unit mid-mounted under the floor and central chain transmission; however, Brennan \"took the drive through a sliding gearbox, rather than an epicyclic system.\" Each auto was fitted with a horizontally-opposed two-cylinder engine. The rest of the vehicle had a more conventional design with full-elliptic springs, right-hand drive and channel or angle iron section chassis.\\nThe 1902 \"touring car\" came complete with a 15-horsepower motor and a double opposed cylinder, horizontal motor and weighed 1,950 pounds. Ignition was by jump spark supplied by dry batteries. Two sets of batteries were carried under the bonnet and front of the dash.\\n\\n\\n==== Automobile shows ====\\nThe company was \"pronounced the best of its kind\" at the Chicago Show in June 1902, as a result of years of experience and the satisfactory use from Maine to California.\\nIn November 1902, Brennan was an exhibitor at the Madison Square Garden Show in New York City. The event included 114 firms such as Century Motor Vehicle Company of Syracuse, Buckmobile Company of Utica, New York and H. H. Franklin Manufacturing Company, also of Syracuse.\\n\\n\\n==== Custom vehicles ====\\nIn March 1908, an automobile gear and 28-horsepower engine for a light touring car were shipped from Syracuse to Java in the East Indies. The machine was from the Brennan factory and it was consigned to a Java importer. The body for the vehicle was built in Java. The machine was shipped by rail to New York City and from there by water to its final destination.\\nBy 1914, the company was advertising automobile parts such as auto engines, pressed steel frames, transmission gears and automobile bodies for sale. The firm was located at 108 Grape Street.\\n\\n\\n=== Automobile engines ===\\nIn June 1902, the company was already producing Brennan Standard Motors which ran from 4 to 30 horsepower. According to advertisements, they were the \"recognized type of motor for automobiles.\" Both water-cooled and air-cooled engines as well as mufflers and vaporizers were manufactured at the company\\'s plant. They also offered a special 8 horsepower motor with a transmission gear.\\nBy early 1903, the company had to enlarge its factory and hire more workers in order to fill the demand for gasoline motors which it sold to both large manufacturers and individuals. The firm had worked up a large and profitable business by furnishing motors in connection with completed drawings for automobiles.\\nAfter the automobile business failed in 1908, the company focused on engines. They produced vehicle motors that were standardized for the \"special service of light vehicles of the runabout class and for the finer styles of automobiles for high speed.\" Brennan was a pioneer building internal combustion engines of its own designs. The company also made component parts for its engines.\\n\\n\\n=== Marine engines ===\\n\\nLater on the company produced engines for motor boats.\\nA small, four-cylinder marine engine called the Imp was one of Brennan\\'s most popular engines.\\n\\n\\n==== Motor boat shows ====\\nSyracuse was not largely represented in the Motor Boat Show that took place in New York City in late February 1910, at the Madison Square Garden. The manufacturers of power boats and gasoline engines were too busy to devote any time to the exposition. Their chief competitors from Syracuse, engine manufacturers, the Barber Brothers, represented by Charles E. Barber and H. J. Leighton, did not participate in the event.\\nP. J. Brennan, said that he could not get away from business to see the show. In discussing the show, Brennan said: \"We exhibited for nine years at a winter motor boat show. We found that it interfered with business and decided to withdraw. This is the busiest time of year with the motor boat manufacturer, and it is especially true this year. The manufacturers have tried to get the show changed to the fall season, but the dealers want it in the winters so they can land orders. We\\'ll stay at home and turn out the goods and let the dealers get the business\"\\nThe B. F. Brown Gas Engine Company was among the big exhibitors at the show.\\n\\nIn 1956, Marshall Brennan formed a partnership with George Shehadi to manufacture custom inboard boats. The Thompson Boat Factory on Cortland Avenue made the hulls and the motors were manufactured by the Brennan Motor Manufacturing Company at 103 South Townsend Avenue.\\n\\n\\n==== Motor boat distributor ====\\nBy April 1928, Brennan was a distributor for the \"famous\" Albany, a 23 feet (7.0 m) runabout, powered by the Brennan marine motor. The price range was $2,200 through $3,000 and top speed of 35 miles per hour (56 km/h). They also offered the Albany cruiser. The company advertised \"there is a Brennan for every size and type of boat up to 75 feet (23 m) with both 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder types and 15 to 200-horsepower. The most highly advertised model was the Brennan De Luxe Six, a 100-horsepower motor that was \"reliable since 1897.\" During 1928, the firm advertised they had boats, engines and outboard motors on display at their plant at 500 East Water Street.\\n\\n\\n=== War work ===\\nIn March 1943, at the beginning of World War II, Brennan was awarded a subcontract for turning out machine-gun plates for the Doyle Corporation.\\n\\n\\n=== Company officers ===\\nOn January 15, 1906, the annual meeting was held and the Brennan Motor Manufacturing Company elected the following directors; P. H. Brennan, A. C. Brennan, T. J. Brennan, Ernest R. Deming and Arthur Perkins.\\nEmmett A. Brennan was an officer of the Brennan Motor Company. He was married to Anna Carroll Brennan (died 1976), formerly of Scott Avenue.\\n\\n\\n=== Employees ===\\n\\nBy 1918, the company headquarters were located at 101 Grape Street and they were hiring lathe operators and trying to find young men interested in training as machinists. A local newspaper advertised in the classified section showed that the company was also hiring bench hands \"on government work.\"\\nDuring 1946, the company was located at 105 South Townsend Street and they were hiring machine workers to operate their Brown and Turret Lathes, Bar and Chuck, Engine Lathes, Sharpe millers and Cincinnati millers.\\nBy July 1972, the company employed nearly 100 employees, mostly shipping parts and components for its engines.\\n\\n\\n=== Plant facilities ===\\nOn January 1, 1910, the firm announced they were adding an addition to their plant on Grape Street.\\nDuring August 1928, the company remodeled their plant at the corner of Water and South Townsend streets, a brick building, for a cost of $800.\\nBy 1972, they were situated in seven buildings on 500 East Water Street at South Townsend Street in Syracuse. Most of the real property owned by the firm had already been sold by July, 1972 when the company closed.\\n\\n\\n=== Truck production ===\\nBrennan was manufacturing trucks as early as 1906 and in June 1912, they announced that the company had started production of 2, 3 and 5 ton motor trucks.\\n\\n\\n=== Company closes ===\\nAt the time the company closed its doors in July 1972, the firm was producing standard high grade four-cycle marine engines and Brennan engines. The firm closed because company president, Emmett A. Brennan, (born 1890) retired.\\n\\n\\n== Advertisements ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nEarly American Automobiles, 1904 models\\nArrgghh! Saving the Brennan buildings: The newest twist - Sean Kirst, Syracuse Post-Standard, June 07, 2007', u'Wrigley Field': u'Wrigley Field /\\u02c8r\\u026a\\u0261li/ is a baseball stadium located in Chicago, Illinois, United States, home of the Chicago Cubs. It was built in 1914 as Weeghman Park for the Chicago Federal League baseball team, the Chicago Whales. The Cubs played their first game at Weeghman Park on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7\\u20136 in eleven innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley, Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before officially becoming Wrigley Field for the 1927 season.\\nLocated in the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field sits on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by \"Mr. Cub\", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current capacity is 41,009, making Wrigley Field the 10th-smallest actively used ballpark. It is the oldest National League ballpark and the second oldest active major league ballpark (after Fenway Park on April 20, 1912), and the only remaining Federal League park.\\nWrigley Field is known for its ivy covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, with lighting installed in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark contains residential streets, in addition to bars, restaurants and other establishments and is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League. It hosted the second annual National Hockey League Winter Classic between the Chicago Blackhawks and the Detroit Red Wings, on January 1, 2009.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nCharles A. Weeghman hired Zachary Taylor Davis as architect for the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914. In late 1915, Weeghman\\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000. Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.\\nIn 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park \"Wrigley Field\".\\nIn 1927 an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.\\nAlthough Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series). The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.\\n\\n\\n=== Renovation ===\\n\\nThe Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years. The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.\\nAfter months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls \\u2013 a move that is opposed by many owners of the rooftop clubs that surround the stadium who worry that such signs may obstruct their sightlines. Before work on the project can begin, the team wants the rooftop owners to agree not to pursue legal action challenging the construction and has continued to negotiate privately with them \\u2013 offering to reduce the size and number of signs to be built \\u2013 in order to gain their assent. After the team could not come to terms with the rooftop owners who have a lease with the team until 2023 in exchange for paying 17 percent of the gross revenues, the team in May 2014 said that it would pursue the original 2013 plan to modify the park.\\n\\n\\n==== Renovation Begins ====\\nThe long-awaited \"1060 Project\", a $575 million Wrigley Field four-year renovation project, started Monday September 29, 2014. The bleachers in both outfields will be expanded, the stadium\\'s footprint will extend further onto both Waveland and Sheffield Avenues, and seven new outfield signs will be installed along with a 2,400 square foot video scoreboard in right field. The parking lots along Clark Street will be excavated for underground players\\' locker rooms and lounges. \\n\\n\\n=== 100th Anniversary ===\\nDuring the 2014 season, the Chicago Cubs celebrated the 100th Anniversary of Wrigley Field throughout the season. Each decade was represented during ten homestands throughout the season. The April 23rd game, the 100th Anniversary, featured the Cubs playing the Arizona Diamondbacks in a throw back game. Each team represented one of the teams which played in the inaugural game at the stadium. The Cubs wore the uniforms of the Chicago Federals, the original occupants of the stadium and Diamondbacks wore uniforms representing the Kansas City Packers whom the Federals played on April 23, 1914.\\n\\n\\n== Features ==\\nWrigley Field follows the jewel box design of ballparks that was popular in the early part of the 20th century. The two recessed wall areas, or \"wells\", located both in left and right field, give those areas a little more length than if the wall were to follow the contour from center field. It is also in those wells, when cross winds are blowing, that balls have a habit of bouncing in all sorts of interesting directions. In addition, there is a long chain-link fence strip running the entire length of the outfield wall, the base of which is about two feet feet down from the top of the wall and the top of which projects out at an angle, primarily used to keep fans from falling out of the bleacher area and onto the field of play, which is about seven to ten feet below the top of the wall. Called \"The basket\", by players and fans alike, the rules of the field state that any ball landing within the basket is ruled a home run, making the distance to hit a home run in Wrigley Field actually shorter than the location of the outfield wall.\\n\\n\\n=== Ivy-covered outfield walls ===\\n\\nThe ballpark is famous for its outfield walls which are covered by ivy. In the first weeks of the baseball season, the ivy has not leafed out, and all that is visible are the vines on which it grows. However, as the baseball season progresses further into spring, the ivy grows thick and green, disguising the hard brick surface of the outfield wall.\\nMany times a ball has been lost in the ivy when hit towards the outfield fences. An outfielder will signal that a ball is lost by raising his hands. When this occurs, the umpires will call time and may rule the play a ground-rule double. If instead the outfielder opts to try to find the ball in the ivy, the ball remains live and any baserunners may advance. Although the ivy appears to \"pad\" the bricks, it is of little practical use in this regard. There have been occasions of fielders being injured when slamming into the wall while pursuing a fly ball.\\nThe ivy that covers the outfield wall is a combination of Boston Ivy and Japanese Bittersweet, which can endure the harsh Chicago winters better than its English cousin. The ivy was planted in 1937 by the Cubs General Manager Bill Veeck, as part of Cubs owner P.K. Wrigley\\'s beautification plan for the bleachers, which had been rebuilt during the 1937 season. Veeck reportedly got the idea of ivy on the walls from Perry Stadium in Indianapolis.\\nWrigley is now the only professional ballpark with an ivy covered outfield wall. Several now-demolished ballparks featured ivy in the playing area, including Forbes Field, Wrigley Field\\'s namesake in Los Angeles, and Bush Stadium in Indianapolis. Bush Stadium still stands, but hasn\\'t hosted baseball in 15 years. After the Indianapolis Indians moved to Victory Field, a race track took its place and the race track owners stripped the ivy off the walls. Omaha\\'s Rosenblatt Stadium, the former home of the College World Series as well as minor league baseball, had an ivy-covered brick wall that was replaced with a padded wall. Some ballparks feature ivy on out-of-play walls, especially as a covering for the batter\\'s eye behind the center field fence.\\nOn April 7, 2013, Total Pro Sports voted Wrigley Field the Best Place to Catch a Game in 2013, owing the award primarily to its architecture and ivy-coated fields.\\n\\n\\n=== Dimensions ===\\nThe distances from home plate to various points in the outfield have remained essentially unchanged since the bleachers were remodeled during the 1937 season. They were originally marked by wooden numbers cut from plywood, painted white, and placed in gaps where the ivy was not allowed to grow. Since the early 1980s, the numbers have been painted directly on the bricks, in yellow. Although the power-alley dimensions are relatively cozy, the foul lines are currently the deepest in the major leagues.\\nIt is 355 feet (108.2 m) to the notch in the wall just beyond the left field foul pole. The point where the bleacher wall begins to curve inward in left-center field, one of the two \"wells\", is an unmarked 357 feet (108.8 m). The front part of the left-center \"well\" is the closest point in the outfield, about 360 feet. The marked left-center field distance is 368 feet (112.2 m). It is closer to true center field than its right-center counterpart is. True center field is unmarked and is about 390 feet. The center field marker, which is to the right of true center field and in the middle of the quarter-circle defining the center field area, is 400 feet (121.9 m). That is the deepest point in the outfield. Right-center field is 368 feet (112.2 m). The notch of the right-center \"well\" is an unmarked 363 feet (110.6 m). The right field foul line is 353 feet (107.6 m). The backstop is listed in media sources as 60.5 feet (18.4 m) behind home plate. Although that distance is standard, the relatively small foul ground area in general gives an advantage to batters.\\n\\n\\n=== Rooftop seats ===\\n\\nOld-time ballparks were often surrounded by buildings that afforded a \"freebie\" look at the game for enterprising souls. In most venues, the clubs took steps to either extend the stands around, or to build spite fences to block the view. Perhaps the most notorious of these was the one at Shibe Park in Philadelphia, which caused a rift between the residents and the team that never healed. The Cubs themselves had built a high fence along the outfield at West Side Park, to hide the field from flats whose back porches were right next to the outer fence of the ballpark.\\nBut at Wrigley it was different. The flat rooftops of the apartment buildings across Waveland and Sheffield, which pre-date the ballpark, were often populated with a reasonable number of fans having cookouts while enjoying the game for free. The Cubs tolerated it quietly until the 1990s, when some owners of those apartments began building little bleacher sections, and charging people to watch the games. The Cubs management became very vocal in expressing their displeasure, threatening legal action. In 2003 they went so far as to line the screens that top the outer walls with opaque strips, to block the best exterior sight lines. That was the closest thing to a spite fence that Wrigley had seen. Therefore the bleachers are sometimes called \"The Spiteless Fence\" as well as \"The Ivy Wall\".\\nThis led to meetings and to a peaceful settlement among the various parties. The building owners agreed to share a portion of their proceeds with the Cubs, and the Cubs obtained permission from the city to expand the ballpark\\'s own bleachers out over the sidewalks and do some additional construction on the open area of the property to the west, bordered by Clark and Waveland, and to close the remnant of Seminary Avenue that also existed on the property. The rooftop seats are now effectively part of the ballpark\\'s seating area, although they are not included in the seating capacity figure.\\nSome of the rooftops have become legendary in their own right. The Lakeview Baseball Club, which sits across Sheffield Avenue (right-field) from the stadium displays a sign that reads, \"Eamus Catuli!\" (roughly Latin for \"Let\\'s Go Cubs!\"\\u2014catuli translating to \"whelps\", the nearest Latin equivalent), flanked by a counter indicating the Cubs\\' long legacy of futility. The counter is labeled \"AC\", for \"Anno Catuli\", or \"In the Year of the Cubs\". The first two digits indicate the number of years since the Cubs\\' last division championship as of the end of the previous season (2008), the next two digits indicate the number of years since the Cubs won the National League Pennant (1945), and the last three digits indicate the number of years since their last World Series win (1908).\\nToday, Wrigley rooftops have become a unique alternative venue to watch baseball games. Many rooftop venues feature bleachers, open bar, specialty food items, and a unique game-day atmosphere, although the quality of the view can vary depending on the specific rooftop location.\\nOwners of 15 on the rooftop locations have a deal with the team lasting until 2023 to pay the team 17 percent of their gross revenue. The owners threatened suit in 2013 when the team announced plans to renovate the ball field and potentially disrupt the sight lines. When the roof owners did not agree to a scaled down plan for renovations of Wrigley, the Cubs owners announced in May 2014 plans to attempt to implement the original 2013 plan for renovations even if it meant battling the issue in court. Cubs owner Ricketts said Wrigley has \"the worst player facilities in Major League Baseball...I am saying it is the time to invest in Wrigley Field and do the things that our competitors do.\" \\n\\n\\n=== Seating capacity ===\\n14,000 (1914)\\n15,000 (1915\\u20131922)\\n20,000 (1923\\u20131926)\\n38,396 (1927)\\n40,000 (1928\\u20131937)\\n38,396 (1938)\\n38,000 (1939\\u20131940)\\n38,396 (1941\\u20131948)\\n38,690 (1949\\u20131950)\\n36,755 (1951\\u20131964)\\n36,644 (1965\\u20131971)\\n37,702 (1972)\\n37,741 (1973\\u20131981)\\n37,272 (1982\\u20131985)\\n38,040 (1986)\\n38,143 (1987\\u20131988)\\n39,600 (1989)\\n38,711 (1990\\u20131993)\\n38,765 (1994\\u20131996)\\n38,884 (1997)\\n38,902 (1998\\u20132005)\\n41,118 (2006)\\n41,160 (2007\\u20132008)\\n41,210 (2009\\u20132010)\\n41,159 (2011)\\n41,009 (2012)\\n41,019 (2013)\\n41,072 (2014\\u2013present)\\n\\n\\n=== Unusual wind patterns ===\\nIn April and May the wind often comes off Lake Michigan (less than a mile to the east), which means a northeast wind \"blowing in\" to knock down potential home runs and turn them into outs. In the summer, however, or on any warm and breezy day, the wind often comes from the south and the southwest, which means the wind is \"blowing out\" and has the potential to turn normally harmless fly balls into home runs. A third variety is the cross-wind, which typically runs from the left field corner to the right field corner and causes all sorts of interesting havoc. Depending on the direction of the wind, Wrigley can either be one of the friendliest parks in the major leagues for pitchers or among the worst. This makes Wrigley one of the most unpredictable parks in the Major Leagues.\\nMany Cubs fans check their nearest flag before heading to the park on game days for an indication of what the game might be like; this is less of a factor for night games, however, because the wind does not blow as hard after the sun goes down.\\nWith the wind blowing in, pitchers can dominate, and no-hitters have been tossed from time to time, though none recently; the last two occurred near the beginning and the end of the 1972 season, by Burt Hooton and Milt Pappas respectively. In the seventh inning of Ken Holtzman\\'s first no-hitter, on August 19, 1969, Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves hammered one that looked like it was headed for Waveland, but the wind caught it just enough for left fielder Billy Williams to leap up and snare it.\\nWith the wind blowing out, some true tape-measure home runs have been hit by well-muscled batters. Sammy Sosa and Dave \"Kong\" Kingman broke windows in the apartment buildings across Waveland Avenue several times. Glenallen Hill put one on a rooftop. Batters have occasionally slugged it into, or to the side of, the first row or two of the \"upper deck\" of the center field bleachers. Sosa hit the roof of the center field camera booth on the fly during the NLCS against the Florida Marlins, some 450 feet away.\\nBut the longest blast was probably hit by Dave Kingman on a very windy day in 1976 while with the Mets. According to local legend, that day, Kingman launched a bomb that landed on the third porch roof on the east (center field) side of Kenmore Avenue, some 550 feet away.\\nNo batter has ever hit the center field scoreboard, however it has been hit by a different kind of ball: a golf ball, hit by Sam Snead, using a two iron.\\nNo matter the weather, many fans congregate during batting practice and games on Waveland Avenue, behind left field, and Sheffield Avenue, behind right field, for a chance to catch a home run ball.\\nSome people also believe that the unpredictable and quick-changing wind current at Wrigley is a major reason why the team has not won a championship in over 100 years. Cubs players may swing the bat one way on one day and get a result far different than they would on a different day. Imagine what this does to a player\\'s psyche and batting technique. Similarly, fielders may have trouble reading where the ball will land because of the wind current. This problem belongs mostly to the Cubs as opposed to another team because the Cubs play in Wrigley more often than does any other team. Additionally, most modern parks are built with aerodynamic modifications in mind, and so the Cubs are at a competitive disadvantage. The goat curse has often been cited as a reason why the Cubs have not won a championship in a long while. Perhaps, however, the effect from the changing wind currents is the real, scientifically-based reason why this old-wives tale seems to be coming true.\\n\\n\\n=== Hand-turned scoreboard ===\\n\\nAlong with Fenway Park, Wrigley is one of the last parks to maintain a hand-turned scoreboard. Unlike the home of the Red Sox, the scoreboard at Wrigley is mounted above the center field bleachers, rather than at ground level, making it harder to hit during play. No players have hit the current scoreboard, although several have come close. The scoreboard was installed in 1937, when Bill Veeck installed the new bleachers. The scoreboard has remained in place ever since, and has only seen minor modifications. The clock was added in 1941, a fifth row of scores was added to each side in 1961 and later a sixth. A set of light stands facing onto the scoreboard was added in 1988 with the introduction of night games. An electronic message board was also added below the scoreboard.\\nThe scoreboard is still manually operated, with scores coming in through a computer (a ticker tape machine was used in the past); a number turner watches the score changes closely, and updates scores by manually replacing the numbers from within the scoreboard. The scoreboard is made out of sheet steel. The numbers that are placed into the inning windows are steel, painted forest green, and numbered with white numerals. The box for the game playing at Wrigley uses yellow numerals for the current inning. The clock, which sits at the top center of the scoreboard, has never lost time in its 71-year existence. Standing over the clock are three flagpoles, one for each division in the National League. There are 15 flags, one for each National League team, and their order on the flagpoles reflects the current standings. The entrance to the scoreboard is a trap-door on the bottom. On the reverse of the scoreboard, visible from the CTA elevated trains, is a blue pennant, with the words \"Chicago Cubs\", in white outlined in red neon. The scoreboard was extensively rehabilitated for the 2010 season.\\nIn 2010, the Cubs toyed with the idea of adding a video screen to the stadium, but the hand-turned scoreboard cannot be moved due to the park\\'s landmark status. The landmark status also prohibits even simple facelifts such as adding two more games on either side (there are 15 teams in both the National and American leagues) of the 12-game, 24-team scoreboard (reflecting MLB from 1969 to 1976), so up to three games (1 NL, 1 AL, and the interleague) each day cannot be posted. Most Cubs players support the addition of a video board, and work on a new video board slated for the 2015 season began at the end of the 2014 season.\\nThose games may eventually be part of the auxiliary video board currently on the right field that may also be added in left field also.\\nIt was announced March 21, 2013, that Alderman Tom Tunney wants to demolish the scoreboard to clear the sky view for nearby residents, who watch games from their rooftops. \\u201cDemolishing the landmark old scoreboard has never been part of any plan discussed or envisioned by the Ricketts family,\\u201d said Dennis Culloton, a spokesman for Tom Ricketts, the Cubs chairman.\\n\\n\\n=== Main entry marquee ===\\n\\nDirectly over the main entrance to the stadium stands the most familiar icon of the exterior of the ballpark, a large red, art deco style marquee, painted in white letters to read \"Wrigley Field, Home of Chicago Cubs\". The marquee was installed circa 1934. March 23, 1960 The Cubs decided to paint their iconic Wrigley Field Marquee a flashier color. It had been green since it was installed in the 1930s. The sign was blue until the 1960s, and originally used changeable letters similar to the scoreboard to announce upcoming games. It originally read \"Home of \"The Cubs\" but was changed to \"Home of Chicago Cubs\" by 1939. This was also changed during football season to reflect the Chicago Bears. In 1982, the two line announcement board was replaced with an electronic message board and a backlit advertising panel was added below (this is now solid red). The marquee utilizes red neon lights at night, showing the familiar \"Wrigley Field\" in red, as the rest of the sign is in darkness. The marquee is so iconic with the park, that the owners of the park, both past, and present, have used the marquee in some way as the park\\'s trademark of sorts, even the CTA platform that services Wrigley Field (the CTA Addison St. station,) has an image of the marquee painted on a wall announcing the destination, rather than simply marking it with black block letters The marquee was painted purple to accommodate the Northwestern Wildcats who played as the home team against the Illinois Fighting Illini in football in November 2010.\\n\\n\\n=== Lights ===\\nThe Cubs were a hold-out against night games for decades, not installing lights at Wrigley until 1988 (after baseball officials announced that the park would be prohibited from hosting any future post-season games without lights). Before then, all games at Wrigley were played during the day. Night games are still limited in number by agreement with the city council. In 1942, then-owner Philip K. Wrigley had planned to install lights, but instead, the lights and stands were scrapped for the World War II effort. In the late 1980s, however, Cubs management insisted that the team was in danger of leaving Wrigley if lights weren\\'t installed, and Major League Baseball threatened to make the Cubs play postseason \"home\" games at Busch Stadium in St. Louis.\\nThe 1984 World Series was scheduled to start in the National League park. But Major League Baseball actually had a contingency plan to instead start the World Series in the American League park in the event that the Chicago Cubs won the National League Championship Series against the San Diego Padres. This would have allowed the Wrigley Field-hosted (i.e. daytime) games to be held over the weekend. In return, only one prime time game (Game 3 on Friday) would have been lost. Wrigley Field wouldn\\'t have lights installed until four years later. To put things in proper perspective, had the Cubs advanced to the Series instead of the Padres, the Detroit Tigers would have hosted Games 1\\u20132, and 6\\u20137 (on Tuesday and Wednesday nights), while the Cubs would have hosted Games 3\\u20135 (on Friday, Saturday and Sunday), with all three games in Chicago starting no later than 1:30 p.m. Central Time. Since the Padres wound up winning the 1984 NLCS, all of this wound up to be trivial.\\nAfter 5,687 consecutive day games played by the Cubs at Wrigley, the lights were finally lit on August 8, 1988, for a game with the Philadelphia Phillies. That game was rained out after three and a half innings, and the first official night game took place the following evening against the New York Mets, a game which the Cubs won 6-4.\\nThe All-American Girls Professional Baseball League\\'s first All-Star Game during the 1943 midseason, was played under temporary lights at Wrigley Field, between two teams composed of South Bend Blue Sox and Rockford Peaches players versus Kenosha Comets and Racine Belles players. It was also the first night game ever played in the historic ballpark (July 1, 1943).\\n\\n\\n== Stadium usage ==\\n\\n\\n=== Baseball ===\\n\\nWeeghman Park\\'s first tenant was the Federal League team, the Chicago Whales, from 1914 to 1915.\\nWeeghman Park / Cubs Park / Wrigley Field has served as the home baseball park for Major League Baseball\\'s Chicago Cubs franchise since 1916.\\n\\n\\n=== Football ===\\n\\nThe Chicago Bears of the National Football League played at Wrigley Field from 1921 to 1970 before relocating to Soldier Field. The team had transferred from Decatur, and retained the name \"Staleys\" for the 1921 season. They renamed themselves the \"Bears\" in order to identify with the baseball team, a common practice in the NFL in those days. Wrigley Field once held the record for the most NFL games played in a single stadium with 365 regular season NFL games, but this record was surpassed in September 2003 by Giants Stadium in New Jersey, thanks to its dual-occupancy by the New York Giants and New York Jets. The game played between the Jets and Miami Dolphins on September 14, 2003 was the 366th regular season NFL game at Giants Stadium breaking Wrigley\\'s regular season record. The 50 seasons the Bears spent at Wrigley Field had been an NFL record until 2006 when Lambeau Field duplicated this feat by hosting the Green Bay Packers for the 50th season, and broke it in 2007.\\nInitially the Bears worked with the stands that were there. Eventually they acquired a large, portable bleacher section that spanned the right and center field areas and covered most of the existing bleacher seating and part of the right field corner seating. This \"East Stand\" raised Wrigley\\'s football capacity to about 47,000, or a net gain of perhaps 9,000 seats over normal capacity. After the Bears left, this structure would live on for several years as the \"North Stand\" at Soldier Field, until it was replaced by permanent seating.\\nThe football field ran north-to-south, i.e. from left field to the foul side of first base. The remodeling of the bleachers made for a very tight fit for the gridiron. In fact, the corner of the south end zone was literally in the visiting baseball team\\'s dugout, which was filled with pads for safety, and required a special ground rule that sliced off that corner of the end zone. The end zone was also shorter than the north, as the south end zone was eight yards, compared to the regulation ten yards. One corner of the north end line ran just inches short of the left field wall. There is a legend that Bronko Nagurski, the great Bears fullback, steamrolled through the line, head down, and ran all the way through that end zone, smacking his leather-helmeted head on the bricks. He went back to the bench and told Coach \"Papa Bear\" George Halas, \"That last guy gave me quite a lick!\" That kind of incident prompted the Bears to hang some padding in front of the wall.\\nThe Bears are second only to the Packers in total NFL championships, and all but one of those (their only Super Bowl championship) came during their tenure at Wrigley. After a half-century, they found themselves compelled to move, because the NFL wanted every one of its stadiums to seat at least 50,000 as a result of the AFL\\u2013NFL merger. The Bears had one experimental game at Dyche Stadium (now Ryan Field) on the Northwestern University campus in 1970, but otherwise continued at Wrigley until their transfer to the lakefront ended their five-decades run on the north side. One remnant of the Bears\\' time at Wrigley was uncovered during the off-season 2007\\u20132008 rebuilding of the playing field: the foundations for the goal posts. Five NFL championship games were played at Wrigley Field; 1933, 1937, 1941, 1943 and 1963.\\nThe Northwestern Wildcats and the Illinois Fighting Illini played a college football game at Wrigley Field on November 20, 2010. It was the first football game at Wrigley Field since 1970 and the first collegiate football game at Wrigley Field since 1938 when the DePaul Blue Demons played its regular games at Wrigley. The field used an east\\u2013west field configuration (third base to right field). In order to keep the playing field at regulation size, the safety clearances for each end zone to the walls in the field were considerably less than normal. In particular, the east (right field) end zone came under scrutiny as its end zone was wedged extremely close to the right field wall (as close as one foot in some areas), forcing the goal posts to be hung from the right field wall in order to fit. Despite extra padding provided in these locations, it was decided that all offensive plays for both teams play to the west end zone, where there was more safety clearance. The east end zone could still be used on defensive and special teams touchdowns, as well as defensive safeties; and, in fact, there was one interception run back for an eastbound touchdown. Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany said that as late as three days before the game, he had only been apprised that the situation wasn\\'t \"anything other than tight.\" When he had a chance to fully vet the situation, however, he concluded that the space surrounding the east end zone was smaller than the minimum of six feet stipulated in NCAA rules, and it would have been too great of a risk to allow offensive plays to be run toward that end zone. The Fighting Illini won the game 48-27 taking home the Land of Lincoln Trophy, which was introduced in 2009.\\n\\n\\n=== Other events ===\\n\\nThe Chicago Sting of the North American Soccer League (NASL) used Wrigley, along with Comiskey Park, for their home matches during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Sting hosted the San Diego Sockers on August 25, 1979 at Wrigley when the Bears were using Soldier Field. Unlike the Bears\\' American football layout, the soccer pitch ran east-to-west, from right field to the foul territory on the third-base side. Soccer returned to Wrigley Field in July 2012, when Italian club A.S. Roma played Poland\\'s Zag\\u0142\\u0119bie Lubin in a friendly match.\\n\\nOn January 1, 2009, the National Hockey League played its 2009 Winter Classic in The Friendly Confines pitting two \"Original Six\" teams - the host Chicago Blackhawks and the visiting Detroit Red Wings - in an outdoor ice hockey game. The rink ran across the field from first base to third base with second base being covered by roughly the center of the rink. According to espn.com, the attendance for this game was 40,818. The Red Wings won 6\\u20134.\\nIn recent years Wrigley Field has been opened on a limited basis to popular concerts, not without some controversy. Local neighborhood groups have expressed concerns about the impact of concert crowds and noise on the surrounding residential neighborhood, particularly in 2009 when three concerts were added to the schedule, one conflicting with an annual neighborhood festival.\\nOn July 19, 2013, the American band Pearl Jam played at Wrigley. The show became the fastest concert to sell-out at Wrigley Field. The show was interrupted for more than two hours due to the threat of lightning.\\nOn July 20, 2013 Jason Aldean performed a sold-out show at the park during his 2013Night Train Tour. Also Kelly Clarkson was added to the bill for the historic night along with Jake Owen and Thomas Rhett\\nOn July 19, 2014 Blake Shelton will perform his first stadium show at the park during his 2014 Ten Times Crazier Tour with The Band Perry, Neal McCoy & Dan + Shay as openers.\\nList of concerts at Wrigley Field\\n\\n\\n== Traditions and mainstays ==\\n\\n\\n=== Corporate sponsorship ===\\n\\nWrigley Field shares its name with the Wrigley Company, as the park was named for its then-owner, William Wrigley Jr., the CEO of the Wrigley Company. As early as the 1920s, before the park became officially known as Wrigley Field, the scoreboard was topped by the elf-like \"Doublemint Twins\", posed as a pitcher and a batter. There were also ads painted on the bare right field wall early in the ballpark\\'s history, prior to the 1923 remodeling which put bleachers there. After that, the Doublemint elves were the only visible in-park advertising. The elves were removed permanently in 1937 when the bleachers and scoreboard were rebuilt. It would be about 44 years before in-park advertising would reappear.\\nWrigley Field has been a notable exception to the recent trend of selling corporate naming rights to sporting venues. The Tribune Company, who owned the park from 1981 to 2009, chose not to rename the ballpark, utilizing other ways to bring corporate sponsorship into the ballpark.\\nDuring the mid-1980s, Anheuser-Busch placed Budweiser and Bud Light advertisements beneath the center field scoreboard. Bud Light became the sponsor of the rebuilt bleachers in 2006.\\nIn the early 2000s, following the trend of many ballparks, a green-screen chroma key board was installed behind home plate, in the line of sight of the center field TV camera, to allow electronic \"rotating\" advertisements visible only to the TV audiences. By 2006, the board was set up to allow advertisements to be both physical and electronic (thus they can be seen in both live and replay shots).\\nIn 2007, the first on-field advertising appeared since the park\\'s early days. Sporting goods firm Under Armour placed its logo on the double-doors between the ivy on the outfield wall, in left-center and right-center fields. Advertisements were also placed in the dugouts, originally for Sears department stores, then Walter E. Smithe furniture and now State Farm insurance.\\nCorporate sponsorship has not been limited to the park itself. Wrigley Field is famous for its view of the neighborhood buildings across Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. In addition to spectators standing or sitting on the apartment roofs, corporate sponsors have frequently taken advantage of those locations as well. In the earliest days of Weeghman Park, one building across Sheffield Avenue advertised a local hangout known as Bismarck Gardens (later called the Marigold Gardens after World War I). That same building has since advertised for the Torco Oil Company, Southwest Airlines, and the Miller Brewing Company.\\nA building across from deep right-center field was topped by a neon sign for Baby Ruth candy beginning in the mid-1930s and running for some 40 years. That placement by the Chicago-based Curtiss Candy Company, coincidentally positioned in the line of sight of \"Babe Ruth\\'s called shot\", proved fortuitous when games began to be televised in the 1940s\\u2014the sign was also in the line of sight of the ground level camera behind and to the left of home plate. The aging sign was eventually removed in the early 1970s.\\nAnother long-standing venue for a sign is the sloping roof of a building behind left-center field. Unsuitable for the bleachers that now decorate many of those buildings, that building\\'s angling roof has been painted in the form of a large billboard since at least the 1940s. In recent years it has borne a bright-red Budweiser sign and, beginning in 2009, an advertisement for Horseshoe Casino. Other buildings have carried signs sponsoring beers, such as Old Style (when it was a Cubs broadcasting sponsor) and Miller; and also WGN-TV, which has telecast Cubs games since April 1948.\\nFor 2008 and 2009, the Cubs worked out an agreement with the Chicago Board Options Exchange to allow the CBOE to auction some 70 box seat season tickets and award naming rights to them.\\nFor the 2009 season, The Chicago Cubs announced that the renovated restaurant space in the southeast corner of Wrigley Field, formerly known as the Friendly Confines Cafe, will now be known as the Captain Morgan Club.\\nOn October 27, 2009, Thomas S. Ricketts officially took over 95% ownership of the Chicago Cubs, Wrigley Field and 20% ownership of Comcast SportsNet Chicago. The Tribune will retain 5% ownership. Ricketts, however, has expressed no interest in selling the naming rights to Wrigley Field, preferring that it retain the name it has used since 1926.\\n\\n\\n=== Win flag ===\\n\\nBeginning in the days of P.K. Wrigley and the 1937 bleacher/scoreboard reconstruction, a flag with either a \"W\" or an \"L\" has flown from atop the scoreboard masthead, indicating the day\\'s result. In case of a doubleheader that is split, both flags are flown. The ritual of raising flags after a game is decades-old.\\nPast Cubs media guides show that the original flags were blue with a white \"W\" and white with a blue \"L\", the latter coincidentally suggesting \"surrender\". In 1978, blue and white lights were mounted atop the scoreboard, to further denote wins and losses.\\nThe flags were replaced in the early 1980s, and the color schemes were reversed with the \"win flag\" being white with a blue W, and the \"loss flag\" the opposite. In 1982, the retired number of Ernie Banks was flying on a foul pole, as white with blue numbers, in 1987, the retired number of Billy Williams joined Banks, the two flags were positioned from the foul poles, Banks from left field, and Williams from right field. Later on, the team retired numbers for Ron Santo, Ryne Sandberg, Ferguson Jenkins and Greg Maddux, with Jenkins and Maddux both using the same number (31).\\nKeeping with tradition, fans are known to bring win flags to home and away games, and displaying them after a Cubs win. Flags are also sold at the ballpark. On April 24, 2008 the Cubs flew an extra white flag displaying \"10,000\" in blue, along with the win flag, as the 10,000th win in team history was achieved on the road the previous night. Alongside the tradition of the \"W\" and \"L\" flags, the song \"Go Cubs Go\" is sung after each home win.\\n\\n\\n=== Take Me Out to the Ball Game ===\\nThe tradition of singing \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" at Cubs home games began when Hall of Fame announcer Harry Caray arrived in 1982 (he had sung it the preceding 7 years as a broadcaster for the White Sox), and it has remained a Wrigley Field staple. After Caray\\'s death, the tradition of a guest conductor began, with former baseball players, other sports stars, actors, and other celebrities invited to sing during the Seventh Inning Stretch. Among the best-known guests have been former Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg, former pitcher Mike Krukow, former longtime Cubs first baseman Mark Grace, former Houston Rockets star Tracy McGrady, Chicago Blackhawks forwards Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane, Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler, comedian Jay Leno, NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon, singers Ozzy Osbourne and Eddie Vedder, boxer and actor Mr. T, actor and lifelong Cub fan Gary Sinise, actors Tom Arnold, James Belushi, and Bill Murray, and WWE wrestler/Chicago native CM Punk.\\n\\n\\n== Popular culture ==\\n\\nWrigley Field had a brief cameo in the movie The Blues Brothers (1980), starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd as Jake and Elwood Blues. Elwood listed 1060 W. Addison as his fake home address on his Illinois driver\\'s license, tricking the police and later the Nazis listening on police radio into heading for Wrigley Field. The Natural (1984), starring Robert Redford, had a scene set at Wrigley but was actually filmed at All-High Stadium in Buffalo, New York. All other baseball action scenes in that movie were shot in Buffalo, at the since-demolished War Memorial Stadium.\\nDuring Cubs games, fans will often stand outside the park on Waveland Avenue, waiting for home run balls hit over the wall and out of the park. However, as a tradition, Cubs fans inside and sometimes even outside the park will promptly throw any home run ball hit by an opposing player back onto the field of play, a ritual depicted in the 1977 stage play, Bleacher Bums, and in the 1993 film, Rookie of the Year.\\nThe ballpark was featured in a scene in Ferris Bueller\\'s Day Off, where the outside marquee read \"Save Ferris\". Many scenes from Rookie of the Year were filmed at Wrigley Field. The director, John Hughes, originally wanted to film at Comiskey Park (he was a White Sox fan) but the team was out of town during filming. Later, the film The Break-Up would use Wrigley Field as the setting for its opening scene. An early 1990s film about Babe Ruth had the obligatory scene in Wrigley Field about the \"called shot\" (the ballpark also doubled as Yankee Stadium for the film). A scoreboard similar to the one existing in 1932 was used, atop an ivy wall (though that did not exist until later in the decade).\\nThe ballpark was used for the establishing tryouts scene in A League of Their Own (1992). This film was a Hollywood account of the 1940s women\\'s baseball league which Cubs owner P.K. Wrigley championed during World War II. Garry Marshall (older brother of the film\\'s director Penny Marshall) has a cameo as \"Walter Harvey\", Wrigley\\'s fictional alter ego. The sign behind the scoreboard was temporarily redone to read \"Harvey Field\", and filming was split between Wrigley and Cantigny Park near Wheaton, IL.\\nMany television series have made featured scenes set in Wrigley Field, including ER, Crime Story, Chicago Hope, Prison Break, Perfect Strangers, and My Boys. Also, the animated comedy Family Guy featured a scene at Wrigley Field that parodied the Steve Bartman incident. In an episode of The Simpsons titled \"He Loves to Fly and He D\\'ohs\", upon arriving in Chicago, Homer walks past a number of famous Chicago landmarks, including Wrigley Field, followed by a generic-looking stadium bearing the name \"Wherever the White Sox play\". In 2007, the band Nine Inch Nails created a promotional audio skit, which involved Wrigley Field being the target of disgruntled war veteran\\'s terrorist attack.\\nThe late-1970s comedy stage play Bleacher Bums was set in the right field bleachers at Wrigley. The video of the play was also set on a stage, with bleachers suggesting Wrigley\\'s layout, rather than in the actual ballpark\\'s bleachers. The tradition of throwing opposition home run balls back was explained by Dennis Franz\\'s character: \"If someone hands you some garbage, you have to throw it back at them!\"\\nA dog park in the Wrightwood Neighbors section of Lincoln Park is named Wiggly Field (1997).\\nThe stadium was also featured on the popular Travel Channel television show Great Hotels, starring Samantha Brown. She attended a game during a visit to Chicago.\\nChicago folk singer Steve Goodman featured Wrigley Field as the setting for his popular Cubs lament \"A Dying Cub Fan\\'s Last Request\", extolling both the trials of the Cubs and the place Wrigley Field holds in Cub fans\\' hearts. After his untimely death from leukemia, Goodman\\'s ashes were in fact scattered at Wrigley Field as described in the lyrics.\\nThe Statler Brothers\\' 1981 song \"Don\\'t Wait On Me\" referred to a then-implausible situation: \"When the lights go on at Wrigley Field\". However, after lights were installed, the line was changed to \"When they put a dome on Wrigley Field\" for their 1989 Live-Sold Out album.\\nA few brief shots of Wrigley Field appear in the 1949 movie It Happens Every Spring. It is also seen on the History Channel\\'s show Life After People.\\nThe stadium made a brief appearance in the open for the first episode of The Tonight Show with Conan O\\'Brien, with Conan rushing through the turnstiles while running from New York (where his previous show, Late Night with Conan O\\'Brien, was taped) to Los Angeles (where his new show was taped, until his role as host ended on January 22, 2010) and then running onto the field while being chased by Cubs security. The route O\\'Brien takes is somewhat misleading, as he is shown running south on Michigan Avenue past the Tribune Tower before arriving at Wrigley Field, which is well north of the Tribune Tower.\\nIn the movie Category 6: Day of Destruction, a terrorist turns off all the electricity at the stadium for a few minutes to demonstrate how hackers could penetrate city electrical systems.\\nAn overgrown Wrigley Field is shown in the new television series Revolution (2012)\\nOn the Sonic Youth live album Smart Bar Chicago 85 the band introduce the final song, \\'Making The Nature Scene\\', as being about \\'Tripping on Acid at Wrigley Field\\'.\\n\\n\\n== Accessibility and transportation ==\\n\\nThe Red Line stop at Addison is less than one block east of Wrigley Field. (The stadium was originally built for proximity to the train tracks.) At the conclusion of games, the scoreboard operator raises to the top of the center field scoreboard either a white flag with a blue \"W\" to signify a Cubs victory or a blue flag with a white \"L\" for a loss. This is done to show the outcome of the game to passengers on passing \"L\" trains, and also to anyone passing by the park. Interestingly, the basic flag color was once the exact opposite of the colors used today (the rationale being that white is the traditional color for surrender). In addition to rail service, the CTA provides several bus routes which service Wrigley. CTA bus routes #22 Clark, #152 Addison and #154 Wrigley Field Express all provide access to the ballpark. Pace also operates the #282 Schaumburg-Wrigley Field Express from Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg and the #779 Yorktown-Wrigley Field Express from Yorktown Shopping Center in Lombard. Biking to the field is also a popular alternative. As Halsted, Addison, and Clark streets all have designated biking lanes, getting to the field via bicycle is a widely used way to avoid hectic pre- and postgame traffic; Wrigley Field offers a complimentary bike check program to accommodate for them. Cyclists may check their bikes up to 2 hours before games at the bike racks off of Waveland Ave, and may pick up their bikes up to one hour after games end.\\nParking in the area remains scarce, but that does not seem to bother fans who want to come to this baseball mecca, which has drawn more than 3 million fans every year from 2004 until 2011 averaging to a near-sellout every day of the season, even with many weekday afternoon games. The little parking that is available around the park can go for as much as $100 per space. To partially alleviate this problem, the Cubs sponsor a parking shuttle service from the nearby DeVry University campus at Belmont and Western as part of their agreement with local neighborhood groups. Recently, several online platforms such as ParkWhiz have offered users the ability to book Wrigley Field Parking before they come to the ballpark. This has become a growing trend for fans who are trying to avoid the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area.\\n\\n\\n== Commemorative stamps ==\\n\\nIn 2001, a series of commemorative postage stamps on the subject of baseball parks was issued by the U.S. Postal Service. Most of them were engravings taken from old colorized postcards, including the illustration of Wrigley Field. In the case of Wrigley, the famous scoreboard was sliced off, presumably to hide the original postcard\\'s banner containing the park\\'s name. It may also be observed that the original black-and-white aerial photo, presumably from the 1945 World Series, was taken from nearly the identical spot as the photo of the 1935 Series, allowing a comparison before and after the 1937 alterations to the bleachers. The stamp and its sources also provide a rare look at the center field bleachers filled with spectators, a practice which was later discontinued due to the risk to batters, who might lose the flight of a pitch amidst the white shirts. This led to the development of darker backgrounds to the pitchers mounds.\\n\\n\\n== Sources ==\\n\\nA Day at the Park, by William Hartel\\nBallparks of North America, by Michael Benson\\nCubs Journal, by John Snyder\\nGreen Cathedrals, by Philip J.

One Shining Moment is traditionally played at the end of CBS Sports\\'s coverage of the championship game of the tournament. The song is played as the winning team\\'s players cut down the nets, to a montage of highlights from the tournament.\\n\\n\\n== Notable artists ==\\nBarrett was the original artist (1987-1993, 2000-2002), but CBS has also broadcast remakes by Teddy Pendergrass (1994\\u20131999) and Luther Vandross (2003\\u20132009, 2011\\u2013). It is believed to be the last song Vandross recorded before his stroke and subsequent death. A version by Jennifer Hudson was used for the 2010 NCAA Tournament. The format of the Hudson video deviated from prior years by cutting away from the tournament highlight montage on several occasions to show footage of Hudson singing with a recording studio backdrop, drawing criticism from some fans and viewers. In March 2011, CBS announced that they would be reinstating the Luther Vandross version for the 2011 Tournament, and have continued to use it ever since.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nBarrett, a singer-songwriter from Michigan, was inspired to write the song in 1986 while watching Larry Bird play on TV at a bar called the Varsity Inn in East Lansing, Michigan, after having played a gig there. He wrote the song down on a napkin the next day, later stating that \"the song came fully formed\" and \"all the lyrics just wrote themselves.\" He passed the song along to high school friend Armen Keteyian, an investigative journalist for CBS Sports and, at that time, Sports Illustrated, who in turn passed it to CBS Sports Creative Director Doug Towey. However, Towey originally planned to debut the song not after a basketball game, but after a football game, Super Bowl XXI. It was to have been the postgame montage from that contest, but CBS ran past the expected airtime and had a primetime show to debut in the next time slot, so the montage was canceled. CBS then asked Barrett for use of the song after the 1987 NCAA championship game, in which Indiana beat Syracuse. Towey decided to use \"One Shining Moment\" to close CBS\\'s coverage of the Tournament. The positive public response led to it becoming an annual feature. It has been used to end CBS\\'s coverage ever since.\\nDoug Towey died on March 11, 2009 and was remembered with a tribute on CBS.\\nTBS will begin showing the final-four championship game every other year starting in 2016. The change has resulted in speculation about the use of montage by other networks.\\n\\n\\n== Lyrics ==\\nThe first verse is about inspiration and hard work. The second verse deals with adversity, accompanied by highlights of injured players and missed shots. The bridge includes lines such as \"Feel the beat of your heart\", often shown with players thumping their chests, and \"Feel the wind in your face\", with video of drives towards the basket.\\nThere is a claim that the first line in the song was changed from \"The ball is kicked\" to \"The ball is tipped.\" However, Barrett said \"My daughter informed me that they claim that the initial line was the ball is kicked. That\\'s not the case. It never was. The original line was, the gun goes off...which I changed to suit the tournament. Ironically - I wrote the song about basketball (after watching Larry Bird) but for some reason (who knows what I was thinking?!?) I didn\\'t write it into the original first line. And so having the first line fall into place as it did was poetic and true.\"\\nThe Chicago White Sox used the version with \"The Gun Goes Off\" to close their telecast on the final game at Comiskey Park on September 30th, 1990.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\"One Shining Moment\" official site\\nLyrics', u'Joralemon Street Tunnel': u\"The Eastern Parkway Line is one of the lines of the IRT division of the New York City Subway, stretching from Downtown Brooklyn south along Flatbush Avenue and east along Eastern Parkway to Crown Heights.

At the time of his retirement, he owned the career records for most consecutive starts (270) and games played (282).\\nHe was born in Wilsonville, in Boyle County, Kentucky, near Parksville. Wilsonville was a small settlement where newly freed slaves had lived. Marshall lived there until he was 5, moving to Columbus, Ohio; however, he came back to Wilsonville every summer until he was 15, when his grandfather died. His aunt, Ella Mae Marshall, was the first special education teacher in Boyle County, and she worked to preserve the black school where she and Marshall\\'s mother had taught.\\n\\n\\n== Football career ==\\nMarshall played college football at the Ohio State University. He left school before his senior year, and played for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League. He was then drafted in the 4th round of the 1960 NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns. Marshall played the 1960 season with the Browns before being traded along with five other players (including fellow defensive lineman Paul Dickson) to the Minnesota Vikings in exchange for two draft picks in the 1961 NFL Draft. He then played from 1961 to 1979 with the Vikings and finished with a then-record 282 consecutive games (since surpassed by Jeff Feagles). He started 270 consecutive games while playing for the Vikings, a record since surpassed by Brett Favre.\\nHe played in Pro Bowls after the 1968 and 1969 NFL seasons. He recovered 30 fumbles, an NFL record. He was a member of the Vikings\\' famous \"Purple People Eaters\" (which consisted of Marshall (DE), Alan Page (DT), Gary Larsen (DT), and Carl Eller (DE), and was the final player from Minnesota\\'s initial expansion team of 1961 to retire. The Vikings credit Marshall with 127 career quarterback sacks, second most in Viking History behind Eller. He is one of 11 players to have played in all four of the Vikings Super Bowl appearances in the 1970s.\\nJim Marshall is also a member of The Pigskin Club Of Washington, D.C.

On October 25, 1964, in a game against the San Francisco 49ers, Marshall recovered a fumble and ran 66 yards with it the wrong way into his own end zone. Thinking that he had scored a touchdown for the Vikings, Marshall then threw the ball away in celebration. The ball landed out of bounds, resulting in a safety for the 49ers. According to Marshall, when he approached Vikings head coach Norm Van Brocklin afterwards, Van Brocklin, after a pause, said, \"Jim, you did the most interesting thing in this game today.\" Despite the gaffe, the Vikings won the game 27\\u201322, with the final margin of victory provided by a Carl Eller touchdown return of a fumble caused by a Marshall sack. Marshall later received a letter from Roy Riegels, infamous for a wrong-way run in the 1929 Rose Bowl, stating, \"Welcome to the club\".\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nIron man\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nFacts, Stories and Accomplishments of Jim Marshall\\nYesterday\\'s News 1971 interview with Marshall after he survived blizzard that killed fellow snowmobiler\\nOld Indestructible, Jim Marshall of the Vikings, retires after 302 straight games Sports Illustrated \\u2013 Dec. 24 \\u2013 31, 1979\\nPictures of Jim Marshall\\'s football cards', u'Finnish banking crisis of the 1990s': u'The Finnish Banking Crisis of 1990s was a deep systemic crisis of the entire Finnish financial sector that took place mainly in the years 1991\\u20131993, after several years of debt-based economic boom in the late 1980s. Its total taxpayer cost was roughly 8% of the Finnish GNP, making it the most severe of the contemporary Nordic banking crises. The crisis has been attributed to a combination of macro-economic turbulence, weak regulation, and bank-specific problems. Governmental intervention included bank takeovers, direct monetary assistance and temporary blanket guarantees to the banks.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nUntil the 1980s, the Finnish financial market was tightly regulated: the Bank of Finland controlled interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and import and export of currency. High interest rates caused a chronic excess in potential demand vs. available supply of debt. Thus, interest rates were relatively high (Helibor ca. 10-15%), the so-called Suomi-lis\\xe4 \"Finland surchange\" versus foreign less regulated markets.\\nIn the early 1980s the financial market was mostly deregulated, leading to a massive credit expansion largely based on foreign debt. Soaring stock and real estate prices attracted frantic speculative activity by banks, private companies and individual investors. Banks aggressively expanded their borrowing in foreign currency, including even banks such as Osuuspankki or the S\\xe4\\xe4st\\xf6pankki group that did not do that earlier. For this, the period of late 1980s is colloquially known in Finland as kasinotalous (\\'casino economy\\').\\n\\n\\n== Banks became speculators ==\\nThe banks started to actively participate in profit-seeking, high-risk operations such as company takeovers and foreign investments, for which they had little experience.\\nThe most active role was played by savings banks and their mutually-owned central institution SKOP (S\\xe4\\xe4st\\xf6pankkien keskusosakepankki), which wanted to break free from the \"old-fashioned\" retail banking business. Some of SKOP\\'s operations were very large compared to the bank\\'s equity, and would later cause great losses: in 1987 it acquired Tampella (a Finnish heavy industry manufacturer that went bankrupt in 1990), and in 1988 it granted 400 million FIM of credit to a Virgin Islands hotel project.\\nSKOP\\'s strategy was to use massive short-term credit, readily available from the money market, in order to finance their operations and long-term investments on the stock market and in corporate loans. This was often highly profitable during the boom, but also caused increasing losses when interest rates rose (Helibor exceeding 15% at times), the stock market turned down, and debtors started defaulting on their loans.\\nAnother bank that collapsed was STS (Suomen Ty\\xf6v\\xe4en S\\xe4\\xe4st\\xf6pankki), another savings bank central joint venture. With approval by STS management, well-connected trade union and socialist party politicians could borrow money without criteria, and reinvest in various ventures, many of which ultimately failed. Notable established, STS-owned businesses to collapse were EKA, a retail store chain, and Haka, a construction company. Ulf Sundqvist, who was chairman of the SDP until resignation in 1993, was held financially responsible for these loose policies that contributed to the downfall of STS Bank, along with other members of the board. His failure to pay the compensation led to a conviction of debtor\\'s dishonesty. Sundqvist became a personification of the crisis.\\n\\n\\n== Culmination of the crisis ==\\nOn several occasions during 1990, SKOP had to resort to overnight debt from the Bank of Finland to cover its liquidity position, as it was unable to raise sufficient funds from the interbank market.\\nSKOP\\'s liquidity position finally collapsed on September 19, 1991, when other banks would not buy its money market debt papers at all. The Bank of Finland took over the control of SKOP and bought the majority of its shares.\\nBad debt was stripped from STS and transferred to the government\\'s bad bank Arsenal, and the remaining parts were sold to another major bank, KOP (Kansallis-Osake-Pankki), which absorbed them completely.\\n\\n\\n== Government intervention and aftermath ==\\nIn 1992, to stabilize the financial sector and to prevent a credit crunch, the government gave a 7.1 billion FIM (\\u20ac1.2 billion), initially zero-interest convertible loan to Finnish banks. Most of the banks (with the notable exception of SKOP) later paid back this loan.\\nA special state-funded Government Guarantee Fund (Valtion vakuusrahasto) was also set up to support the savings banks, many of which were first consolidated and then broken up; the healthy parts were sold to commercial banks. Ownership of defaulted or nonperforming assets was transferred to a bad bank, OHY Arsenal.\\nThe total public expenditure in support of the banks has been estimated as roughly 50 billion FIM (\\u20ac8.4 billion), the vast majority of which was spent on the savings banks.\\nCommercial banks raised capital from their stockholders to cover their losses. The two largest Finnish commercial banks, Suomen Yhdyspankki and Kansallispankki, merged in 1995 to become Merita (later Nordea).\\n\\n\\n== Key people involved ==\\nMauno Koivisto, President of Finland and the architect of the \"strong markka\" policy\\nEsko Aho, Prime Minister during the crisis\\nIiro Viinanen, Minister of Finance, architect of the financial policies applied, including subsequent austerity\\nChristopher Wegelius, CEO and Chairman of the Board of SKOP\\nKauko Juhantalo, Minister of Trade and Industry, convicted for taking bribes from Wegelius and expelled from Parliament\\nUlf Sundquist, CEO of STS Bank and party president of the Social Democratic Party of Finland\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nHelibor\\nList of banking crises\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n^ a b Liisa Halme: The 1990s banking crisis in Finland: main causes and consequences, lessons for the future. 2002.\\n^ Managing the banking crisis: The Finnish banking crisis of the 1990s and its management.

This regulatory structure creates transparency between banking institutions and the individuals and corporations with whom they conduct business, among other things.\\nGiven the interconnectedness of the banking industry and the reliance that the national (and global) economy hold on banks, it is important for regulatory agencies to maintain control over the standardized practices of these institutions. Supporters of such regulation often hinge their arguments on the \"too big to fail\" notion. This holds that many financial institutions (particularly investment banks with a commercial arm) hold too much control over the economy to fail without enormous consequences. This is the premise for government bailouts, in which government financial assistance is provided to banks or other financial institutions who appear to be on the brink of collapse. The belief is that without this aid, the crippled banks would not only become bankrupt, but would create rippling effects throughout the economy leading to systemic failure.\\n\\n\\n== Objectives of bank regulation ==\\nThe objectives of bank regulation, and the emphasis, vary between jurisdictions. The most common objectives are:\\nPrudential\\u2014to reduce the level of risk to which bank creditors are exposed (i.e. to protect depositors)\\nSystemic risk reduction\\u2014to reduce the risk of disruption resulting from adverse trading conditions for banks causing multiple or major bank failures\\nAvoid misuse of banks\\u2014to reduce the risk of banks being used for criminal purposes, e.g. laundering the proceeds of crime\\nTo protect banking confidentiality\\nCredit allocation\\u2014to direct credit to favored sectors\\nIt may also include rules about treating customers fairly and having corporate social responsibility (CSR)\\n\\n\\n== General principles of bank regulation ==\\nBanking regulations can vary widely across nations and jurisdictions. This section of the article describes general principles of bank regulation throughout the world.\\n\\n\\n=== Minimum requirements ===\\nRequirements are imposed on banks in order to promote the objectives of the regulator. Often, these requirements are closely tied to the level of risk exposure for a certain sector of the bank. The most important minimum requirement in banking regulation is maintaining minimum capital ratios. To some extent, U.S. banks have some leeway in determining who will supervise and regulate them.\\n\\n\\n=== Supervisory review ===\\nBanks are required to be issued with a bank license by the regulator in order to carry on business as a bank, and the regulator supervises licensed banks for compliance with the requirements and responds to breaches of the requirements through obtaining undertakings, giving directions, imposing penalties or revoking the bank\\'s license.\\n\\n\\n=== Market discipline ===\\nThe regulator requires banks to publicly disclose financial and other information, and depositors and other creditors are able to use this information to assess the level of risk and to make investment decisions. As a result of this, the bank is subject to market discipline and the regulator can also use market pricing information as an indicator of the bank\\'s financial health.\\n\\n\\n== Instruments and requirements of bank regulation ==\\n\\n\\n=== Capital requirement ===\\n\\nThe capital requirement sets a framework on how banks must handle their capital in relation to their assets. Internationally, the Bank for International Settlements\\' Basel Committee on Banking Supervision influences each country\\'s capital requirements. In 1988, the Committee decided to introduce a capital measurement system commonly referred to as the Basel Capital Accords. The latest capital adequacy framework is commonly known as Basel III. This updated framework is intended to be more risk sensitive than the original one, but is also a lot more complex.\\n\\n\\n=== Reserve requirement ===\\n\\nThe reserve requirement sets the minimum reserves each bank must hold to demand deposits and banknotes. This type of regulation has lost the role it once had, as the emphasis has moved toward capital adequacy, and in many countries there is no minimum reserve ratio. The purpose of minimum reserve ratios is liquidity rather than safety. An example of a country with a contemporary minimum reserve ratio is Hong Kong, where banks are required to maintain 25% of their liabilities that are due on demand or within 1 month as qualifying liquefiable assets.\\nReserve requirements have also been used in the past to control the stock of banknotes and/or bank deposits. Required reserves have at times been gold, central bank banknotes or deposits, and foreign currency.\\n\\n\\n=== Corporate governance ===\\nCorporate governance requirements are intended to encourage the bank to be well managed, and is an indirect way of achieving other objectives. As many banks are relatively large, with many divisions, it is important for management to maintain a close watch on all operations. Investors and clients will often hold higher management accountable for missteps, as these individuals are expected to be aware of all activities of the institution. Some of these requirements may include:\\nTo be a body corporate (i.e. not an individual, a partnership, trust or other unincorporated entity)\\nTo be incorporated locally, and/or to be incorporated under as a particular type of body corporate, rather than being incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction.\\nTo have a minimum number of directors\\nTo have an organisational structure that includes various offices and officers, e.g. corporate secretary, treasurer/CFO, auditor, Asset Liability Management Committee, Privacy Officer, Compliance Officer etc. Also the officers for those offices may need to be approved persons, or from an approved class of persons.\\nTo have a constitution or articles of association that is approved, or contains or does not contain particular clauses, e.g. clauses that enable directors to act other than in the best interests of the company (e.g. in the interests of a parent company) may not be allowed.\\n\\n\\n=== Financial reporting and disclosure requirements ===\\nAmong the most important regulations that are placed on banking institutions is the requirement for disclosure of the bank\\'s finances. Particularly for banks that trade on the public market, in the US for example the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires management to prepare annual financial statements according to a financial reporting standard, have them audited, and to register or publish them. Often, these banks are even required to prepare more frequent financial disclosures, such as Quarterly Disclosure Statements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 outlines in detail the exact structure of the reports that the SEC requires.\\nIn addition to preparing these statements, the SEC also stipulates that directors of the bank must attest to the accuracy of such financial disclosures. Thus, included in their annual reports must be a report of management on the company\\'s internal control over financial reporting. The internal control report must include: a statement of management\\'s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company; management\\'s assessment of the effectiveness of the company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the company\\'s most recent fiscal year; a statement identifying the framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of the company\\'s internal control over financial reporting; and a statement that the registered public accounting firm that audited the company\\'s financial statements included in the annual report has issued an attestation report on management\\'s assessment of the company\\'s internal control over financial reporting. Under the new rules, a company is required to file the registered public accounting firm\\'s attestation report as part of the annual report. Furthermore, the SEC added a requirement that management evaluate any change in the company\\'s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during a fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company\\'s internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\n\\n=== Credit rating requirement ===\\nBanks may be required to obtain and maintain a current credit rating from an approved credit rating agency, and to disclose it to investors and prospective investors. Also, banks may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating. These ratings are designed to provide color for prospective clients or investors regarding the relative risk that one assumes when engaging in business with the bank. The ratings reflect the tendencies of the bank to take on high risk endeavors, in addition to the likelihood of succeeding in such deals or initiatives. The rating agencies that banks are most strictly governed by, referred to as the \"Big Three\" are the Fitch Group, Standard and Poor\\'s and Moody\\'s. These agencies hold the most influence over how banks (and all public companies) are viewed by those engaged in the public market. In recent years, following the Great Recession, many economists have argued that these agencies face a serious conflict of interest in their core business model. Clients pay these agencies to rate their company based on their relative riskiness in the market. The question then is, to whom is the agency providing its service: the company or the market?\\nEuropean financial economics experts- notably the World Pensions Council (WPC) have argued that European powers such as France and Germany pushed dogmatically and naively for the adoption of the \"Basel II recommendations\", adopted in 2005, transposed in European Union law through the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). In essence, they forced European banks, and, more importantly, the European Central Bank itself, to rely more than ever on the standardized assessments of \"credit risk\" marketed aggressively by two US credit rating agencies- Moody\\'s and S&P, thus using public policy and ultimately taxpayers\\' money to strengthen anti-competitive duopolistic practices akin to exclusive dealing. Ironically, European governments have abdicated most of their regulatory authority in favor of a non-European, highly deregulated, private cartel.\\n\\n\\n=== Large exposures restrictions ===\\nBanks may be restricted from having imprudently large exposures to individual counterparties or groups of connected counterparties. Such limitation may be expressed as a proportion of the bank\\'s assets or equity, and different limits may apply based on the security held and/or the credit rating of the counterparty. Restricting disproportionate exposure to high-risk investment prevents financial institutions from placing equity holders\\' (as well as the firm\\'s) capital at an unnecessary risk.\\n\\n\\n=== Activity and affiliation restrictions ===\\nIn the US in response to the Great depression of the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt\\u2019s under the New Deal enacted the Securities Act of 1933 and the Glass-Steagall Act (GSA), setting up a pervasive regulatory scheme for the public offering of securities and generally prohibiting commercial banks from underwriting and dealing in those securities. GSA prohibited affiliations between banks (which means bank-chartered depository institutions, that is, financial institutions that hold federally insured consumer deposits) and securities firms (which are commonly referred to as \\u201cinvestment banks\\u201d even though they are not technically banks and do not hold federally insured consumer deposits); further restrictions on bank affiliations with non- banking firms were enacted in Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) and its subsequent amendments, eliminating the possibility that companies owning banks would be permitted to take ownership or controlling interest in insurance companies, manufacturing companies, real estate companies, securities firms, or any other non-banking company. As a result, distinct regulatory systems developed in the United States for regulating banks, on the one hand, and securities firms on the other.\\n\\n\\n== Too big to fail and moral hazard ==\\nAmong the reasons for maintaining close regulation of banking institutions is the aforementioned concern over the global repercussions that could result from a bank\\'s failure; the idea that these bulge bracket banks are \"too big to fail\". The objective of federal agencies is to avoid situations in which the government must decide whether to support a struggling bank or to let it fail. The issue, as many argue, is that providing aid to crippled banks creates a situation of moral hazard. The general premise is that while the government may have prevented a financial catastrophe for the time being, they have reinforced confidence for high risk taking and provided an invisible safety net. This can lead to a vicious cycle, wherein banks take risks, fail, receive a bailout, and then continue to take risks once again.\\n\\n\\n== By country ==\\nBank regulation in the United States\\nUnited Kingdom banking law\\nChina Banking Regulatory Commission\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nAnti-money laundering\\nBank condition\\nBank failure\\nBank run\\nBusiness process management\\nCredit rating agency\\nData Loss Prevention\\nFinancial regulation\\nFinancial repression\\nKnow your customer\\nLate-2000s financial crisis\\nList of bank stress tests\\nMonetary policy\\nMoney market\\nMoral hazard\\nToo big to fail\\nRAROC\\nStandards\\nISO 4217 \\u2013 Standard for unique 3 digit currency code\\nISO 6166 \\u2013 Standard for unique identifier for securities ISIN\\nISO 8109 \\u2013 Standard for format and unique identifiers for Eurobonds\\nISO 9362 \\u2013 Standard format of Business Identifier Codes to identify Banks also known as BIC\\nISO 10962 \\u2013 Standard for financial instrument classification codes\\nISO/IEC 15944 \\u2013 Standard that provides a consolidated vocabulary of eBusiness concepts\\nISO 19092-1 \\u2013 Standard for biometric security in financial applications\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nMiddle East Banking & Finance News \\u2014 ArabianBusiness.com\\nBanking & Finance News \\u2014 BankingInsuranceSecurities.com\\n\\n\\n=== Reserve requirements ===\\nReserve Requirements - Fedpoints - Federal Reserve Bank of New York\\n\\n\\n=== Capital requirements ===\\nBasel II: Revised international capital framework\\nFDIC: Risk - Based Assessment System\\n\\n\\n=== Agenda from ISO ===\\nISO/TR 17944\\n\\n\\n=== Various Countries ===\\n\\n\\n==== Israel ====\\nIsraeli Banking Law', u'Free Software Foundation Europe': u'The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) was founded in 2001 to support all aspects of the free software movement in Europe. FSFE is a charitable registered association (eingetragener Verein) under German law, and has registered \\'chapters\\' in several European countries. It is as an official European sister organization of the U.S.-based Free Software Foundation (FSF). FSF and FSFE are financially and legally separate entities.\\nFSFE believes that access to and control of software determines who may participate in a digital society. Therefore, the freedoms to use, copy, modify and redistribute software, as described in The Free Software Definition, are necessary for equal participation in the Information Age.\\n\\n\\n== Goals ==\\nThe focus of FSFE\\'s work is political, legal, and social with the aim of promoting Free Software and the ethical, philosophical, social, political and commercial values that it implements. In particular, it\\nis actively promoting Free Software politically as Europe-based global competence center in dialog with politicians and press.\\nfollows and seeks to influence legal and political activities that are contrary to the goals and values of Free Software.\\nprovides a contact point and orientational help on all issues regarding Free Software.\\nworks closely together with lawyers active in the Free Software area in Universities and practices in order to follow and influence the legal discourse. Also it cooperates with lawyers throughout Europe to maximize the legal security of Free Software.\\nsupports, coordinates and develops projects in the Free Software area, especially the GNU Project. It also provides computer resources to Free Software developers to enable them to continue their developments.\\nhelps companies to develop business models based on Free Software or fit existing models to it; it encourages companies in their evolution to Free Software. To make it easier for companies based on Free Software to be commercially successful, the FSF Europe also seeks to broaden the market for Free Software.\\nhelps coordinating and networking other initiatives in the Free Software area.\\n\\n\\n== Example projects ==\\n\\nSoftware patents in Europe\\nAccording to the FSFE, software patents for Europe are currently being pushed forward actively by a lobby gathering around the European patent office and the Business Software Alliance (BSA), which represents the interests of the largest U.S. companies. Software patents are considered by the FSFE to be a menace to society and economy and FSF Europe is actively involved in the resistance to such plans.\\nEuropean Union v. Microsoft\\nIn 2001 the European Union, through the DG Competition of the European Commission (led by Prof. Mario Monti), started investigating Microsoft\\'s dominant position in the desktop operating systems. The Free Software Foundation Europe was invited by the EC to represent the stance of the Free Software movement. In 2004 FSFE was admitted as an intervening third party in the appeal against the Decision of the Commission and, also representing the Samba Team, was one of the only two interveners to remain active in the proceedings from start to end. It provided strong evidence in court thanks to the effort volunteers like Andrew Tridgell, Jeremy Allison, Volker Lendeke and their lawyer, Carlo Piana. The case is now considered one of the leading cases in European antitrust.\\nWorld Intellectual Property Organization\\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is one of 16 specialized agencies of the United Nations system of organisations. Its role is to administer 23 international treaties dealing with different aspects of limited monopolies on knowledge. As an observer to WIPO and together with a global coalition of other players with similar goals, FSFE is working towards reshaping it as a \"World Intellectual Wealth Organisation.\"\\nFreedom Task Force\\nThe legal project of FSFE. \"The Freedom Task Force is a legal infrastructure project that helps individuals, projects and businesses understand Free Software and the opportunities that it presents. The FTF is primarily focused on Free Software licensing issues and managing FSFE\\'s legal affairs. Our goal is to educate people in the proper use of Free Software.\"\\nEach month, FSFE publish a newsletter, in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish, of their activities that can be mentioned in public.\\n\\n\\n== Structure ==\\nFrom FSFE\\'s published \"Self-Conception\": \"The people of the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), see ourselves as Europeans from different cultures with the shared goal of co-operation across cultures and of developing a common culture of co-operation from a regional to a global level. We form a non-profit non-governmental organisation and network that itself is part of a global network of people with common goals and visions. We are not representative for anyone but ourselves and our work. Our common work and dedication to freedom in all aspects of digital society is what defines us.\" \\nInternally, the FSFE has a consensus-oriented, team structure in which participation is determined by each persons willingness to participate and do work. A democratic and representative-democratic model functions as a fallback for when the consensus-based approach either reaps no results or a quick decision is needed.\\n\\n\\n=== Legal structure ===\\nThe FSFE has a modular legal structure with a central \"Hub\" organisation and the possibility of local legal bodies, called \"Chapters\". The Hub is a charitable association (\"e.V.\") which is, by happenstance, registered in Germany.\\nAs well as being in regular contact with the other FSFs (FSF, FSFI, FSFLA), FSFE has a structure of organisations which are official associates. These are mostly national-level free software groups.\\n\\n\\n=== Awards ===\\nIn 2010 FSFE received the Theodor Heuss Medal in recognition of its work for freedom in the information society. The medal is awarded once a year in Stuttgart by a non-partisan foundation named after West Germany\\'s first president.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nFree Software Foundation\\nFree Software Foundation Latin America\\nFree Software Foundation India\\nOpenForum Europe\\nEuropean Committee for Interoperable Systems\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nFree Software Foundation Europe\\nSelf-Conception of the FSF Europe\\nThe FSFE Fellowship\\nCurrent work of FSFE\\nThe current FSF Europe team\\nAssociate Organisations of the FSF Europe\\nOpen Parliament - petition to use Open Standards in EU\\nSlashdot news coverage:\\nWorld Intellectual Wealth Organisation Proposed, October 2004\\nFSFE becomes WIPO observer, November 2004\\nVideo and Transcripts of GPLv3 Event Now Online, July 2006\\nEU Patent Wars to Resume, August 2006\\nTranscripts of GPLv3 talks from Tokyo, November 2006\\nFSFE Supports Microsoft Antitrust Investigation, December 2007\\nTasks of a Free Software Legal Department, October 2008\\nFSFE Launches Free PDF Readers Campaign, February 2009\\nSteve Jobs Hints at Theora Lawsuit, April 2010\\n\\n\\n== References ==', u'MBTA': u'The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, often referred to as the MBTA or The T, is the public operator of most bus, subway, commuter rail, and ferry routes in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area. Officially a \"body politic and corporate, and a political subdivision\" of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, it was formed in 1964. Its immediate predecessor, the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), was immortalized by The Kingston Trio in the popular folk-protest lament \"M.T.A.\" Locals call it \"The T\", after its logo, the letter T in a circle, adopted in the 1960s and inspired by the Stockholm metro. In 2008, the system averaged 1.3 million passenger trips each weekday, of which the subway averaged 598,200, making it the fourth busiest subway system in the United States. The Green Line and Ashmont\\u2013Mattapan High Speed Line comprise the busiest light-rail system in the US, with a weekday ridership of 255,100.\\nThe MBTA operates an independent law enforcement agency, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police. In 2010, 33% of workers in the city proper commuted by public transport.\\nThe MBTA is one of only two US transit agencies that operates all of the five major types of terrestrial mass transit vehicles: regional (commuter) rail trains, \"heavy\" rapid transit (subway/elevated) trains, light rail vehicles (trolleys), electric trolleybuses, and motor buses. The other is Philadelphia\\'s Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA).\\nThe MBTA is the largest consumer of electricity in Massachusetts, and the second-largest land owner (after the Department of Conservation and Recreation). In 2007, its CNG bus fleet was the largest consumer of alternative fuels in the state.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nMass transportation in Boston was provided by private companies, often granted charters by the state legislature for limited monopolies, with powers of eminent domain to establish a right-of-way, until the creation of the MTA in 1947. Development of mass transportation followed both existing economic and population patterns, and helped shape those patterns.\\n\\n\\n=== Railways ===\\nShortly after the steam locomotive became practical for mass transportation, the private Boston and Lowell Railroad was chartered in 1830, connecting Boston to Lowell, a major northerly mill town, via one of the oldest railroads in North America. This marked the beginning of the development of American intercity railroads, which in Massachusetts would later become the MBTA Commuter Rail system and the Green Line \"D\" Branch.\\n\\n\\n=== Streetcars ===\\nStarting with the opening of the Cambridge Railroad on March 26, 1856, a profusion of streetcar lines appeared in Boston under chartered companies. Therefore, in spite of changes of the companies, Boston is the city with the oldest continuously working streetcar system in the world. Later, many of these companies consolidated, and animal-drawn vehicles were converted to electric propulsion.\\n\\n\\n=== Subways and elevated railways ===\\n\\nStreetcar congestion in downtown Boston led to the establishment of subways and elevated rail, the former in 1897 and the latter in 1901. The Tremont Street Subway was the first rapid transit tunnel in the United States. The grade-separated railways added transportation capacity while avoiding delays caused by intersections with cross streets. The first elevated railway and the first rapid transit line in Boston were built three years before the first underground line of the New York City Subway, but 34 years after the first London Underground lines, and long after the first elevated railway in New York.\\nVarious extensions and branches were added to the Boston subway at both ends, bypassing more surface tracks. As grade-separated lines were extended, street-running lines were cut back for faster downtown service. The last elevated heavy rail or \"El\" segments in Boston were at the northern end of the Orange Line (relocated in 1975), and the southern end of the Orange Line (relocated into the Southwest Corridor in 1987). However the elevated Green Line segment above Causeway Street from North Station to Science Park remained in service until 2004, when it was relocated into a tunnel with an incline to reconnect to the Lechmere Viaduct. The Viaduct remains in service as of 2014, having been renovated, with no plans for its replacement in the near future.\\n\\n\\n=== Buses ===\\nThe Boston Elevated Railway started replacing rail with buses in 1922. In 1936, it started replacing rail with trackless trolleys. The last Middlesex and Boston Street Railway streetcar ran in 1930. By the beginning of 1953, the only remaining streetcar lines fed two tunnels - the main Tremont Street Subway network downtown and the short tunnel (now the Harvard Bus Tunnel) in Harvard Square.\\n\\n\\n=== Public enterprise ===\\nThe old elevated railways proved to be an eyesore and required several sharp curves in Boston\\'s twisty streets. The Atlantic Avenue Elevated was closed in 1938 amidst declining ridership and was demolished in 1942. As rail passenger service became increasingly unprofitable, largely due to rising automobile ownership, government takeover prevented abandonment and dismantlement. The MTA purchased and took over subway, elevated, streetcar, and bus operations from the Boston Elevated Railway in 1947.\\nIn the 1950s, the MTA ran new subway extensions, while the last two streetcar lines running into the Pleasant Street Portal of the Tremont Street Subway were substituted with buses in 1953 and 1962.\\nWhile the operations of the MTA were relatively stable by the early 1960s, the privately operated commuter rail lines were in freefall. The New Haven Railroad, New York Central Railroad, and Boston and Maine Railroad were all financially struggling; deferred maintenance was hurting the mainlines while most branch lines had been discontinued. The 1945 Coolidge Commission plan assumed that most of the commuter rail lines would be replaced by shorter rapid transit extensions, or simply feed into them at reduced service levels. The entire Old Colony Railroad system serving the southeastern part of the state was abandoned by the New Haven Railroad in 1959, triggering calls for state intervention. Between January 1963 and March 1964, the Mass Transportation Commission tested different fare and service levels on the B&M and New Haven systems. Determining that commuter rail operations were important but could not be financially self-sustaining, the MTC recommended an expansion of the MTA to commuter rail territory.\\nOn August 3, 1964, the MBTA succeeded the MTA, with an enlarged service area intended to subsidize continued commuter rail operations. The original 14-municipality MTA district was expanded to 78 cities and towns. Several lines were briefly cut back while contracts with out-of-district towns were reached, but except for the Central Mass, West Medway, Dedham, and Blackstone lines (all with just one daily round trip) and B&M New Hampshire services, most cuts were temporary. The MBTA bought the Penn Central (New York Central and New Haven) commuter rail lines in January 1973, Penn Central equipment in April 1976, and all B&M commuter assets in December 1976; these purchases served to make the system state-owned with the private railroads retained solely as operators.\\nThe MBTA assigned colors to its four rapid transit lines in 1965, and lettered the branches of the Green Line from north to south. Shortage of streetcars among other factors caused bus substitution of rail service on two branches of the Green Line. The \"A\" Branch ceased operating in 1969 and was replaced by the 57 bus. The portion of the \"E\" Branch from Heath Street to Arborway was replaced by buses in 1985.\\nThe MBTA purchased bus routes in the outer suburbs to the north and south from the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway in 1968. As with the commuter rail system, many of the outlying routes were dropped shortly before or after the takeover due to low ridership and high operating costs.\\nIn the 1970s, the MBTA received a boost from the Boston Transportation Planning Review area-wide re-evaluation of the role of mass transit relative to highways. Producing a moratorium on highway construction inside Route 128, numerous mass transit lines were planned for expansion by the Voorhees-Skidmore, Owings and Merrill-ESL consulting team. The removal of elevated lines continued, and the closure of the Washington Street Elevated in 1987 brought the end of rapid transit service to the Roxbury neighborhood. Between 1971 and 1985, the Red Line was extended both north and south, providing not only additional subway system coverage, but also major parking structures at several of the terminal and intermediate stations.\\n\\n\\n==== Kickback schemes ====\\n\\nBetween 1980 and 1981, Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation and MBTA Chairman Barry Locke and the Assistant Director of the MBTA\\'s Real Estate Department Frank J. Walters, Jr. ran a number of kickback schemes at the MBTA. The kickbacks were discovered when MBTA General Manager James O\\'Leary accidentally opened an envelope meant for Locke that contained the proceeds from one of the schemes. A total of seventeen people and one corporation would be indicted for their roles in kickback schemes at the MBTA. Locke was convicted of five counts of bribery and sentenced to 7 to 10 years in prison. Locke is the only Massachusetts Cabinet Secretary to be convicted of a felony while in office since the state\\'s adoption of the cabinet system in 1970.\\n\\n\\n=== 21st century changes ===\\nBy 1999, the district was expanded further to 175 cities and towns, adding most that were served by or adjacent to commuter rail lines, though the MBTA did not assume responsibility for local service in those communities adjacent to or served by commuter rail.\\n\\nA turning point in funding occurred in 2000. Prior to July 1, 2000, the MBTA was reimbursed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for all costs above revenue collected (net cost of service). Beginning on that date, the T was granted a dedicated revenue stream consisting of amounts assessed on served cities and towns, along with a dedicated 20% portion of the 5% state sales tax. The MBTA now had to live within this \"forward funding\" budget.\\nThe Commonwealth assigned to the MBTA responsibility for increasing public transit to compensate for increased automobile pollution from the Big Dig. The T submerged a nearby portion of the Green Line and rebuilt Haymarket and North Stations during Big Dig construction. However, these projects have strained the MBTA\\'s limited resources, since the Big Dig project did not include funding for these improvements. Since 1988, the MBTA has been the fastest expanding transit system in the country, even as Greater Boston has been one of the slowest growing metropolitan areas in the United States. When, in 2000, the MBTA\\'s budget became limited, the agency began to run into debt from scheduled projects and obligatory Big Dig remediation work, which have now given the MBTA the highest debt of any transit authority in the country. In an effort to compensate, rates underwent an appreciable hike on January 1, 2007. Increasingly, local advocacy groups are calling on the state to assume $2.9 billion of the authority\\'s now approximate debt of $9 billion, the interest on which severely limits funds available for required projects.\\nWith the 2004 replacement of the Causeway Street Elevated with a subway connection, the only remaining elevated railways are a short portion of the Red Line at Charles/MGH, the Red Line between Andrew Station (once the train exits the tunnel beyond Andrew Station going southbound) and proceeding southbound to either Ashmont Station on the Ashmont line or Braintree Station on the Braintree line, and a short portion of the Green Line between Science Park and Lechmere.\\nIn 2006, the creation of the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority saw Framingham, Natick, Weston, Sudbury, Wayland, Marlborough, Ashland, Sherborn, Hopkinton, Holliston, and Southborough subtract their MWRTA assessment from their MBTA assessment. Communities that are also members of other RTAs such as CATA, MVRTA, LRTA, WRTA, GATRA, and BAT may also subtract their RTA assessment from their MBTA assessment. The amount of funding the MBTA received remained the same; the assessment on remaining cities and towns increased but is still allocated by the same formula.\\nOn October 31, 2007, the MBTA reestablished commuter rail service to the Greenbush section of Scituate, the third branch of the Old Colony service. Rail renovation on the Green Line \"D\" Branch took place in the summer of 2007. New, low-floor cars on the line were introduced on December 1, 2008.\\nIn 2008, Daniel Grabauskas, then the MBTA General Manager, revealed that the MBTA cut trips from published train and bus schedules without informing passengers, referred to as \\u201chidden service cuts\\u201d, saying this misrepresentation of service had been happening for years. Grabauskas said this practice has been ended.\\nOn May 28, 2008, a westbound trolley on the Green Line \"D\" Branch slammed into a stopped train between the Waban and Woodland stations shortly after 6 p.m. At least seven people were injured, and the operator of the moving train, Terrese Edmonds, 24, was killed. On May 8, 2009, two Green Line trolleys collided between Park Street and Government Center when the driver of one of them, 24-year-old Aiden Quinn, was text messaging his girlfriend. A rule banning cell phones for operators while driving their bus, train, or streetcar was put into place days later. On June 26, 2009, Governor Deval Patrick signed a law to place the MBTA along with other state transportation agencies within the administrative authority of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT), with the MBTA now part of the Mass Transit division (MassTrans). The 2009 transportation law continued the MBTA corporate structure and changed the MBTA board membership to the five Governor-appointed members of the Mass DOT Board.\\nRhode Island, which has funded commuter rail service to Providence since 1988, paid for extensions of the Providence/Stoughton Line to T.F. Green Airport in 2010 and Wickford Junction in 2012. The Fairmount Line, located entirely in the southern reaches of Boston, has been undergoing an improvement project since 2002. The first new station, Talbot Ave, opened in November 2012.\\nImmediately following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, the MBTA was partially shut down and National Guardsmen were deployed in various stations around the city. During the ensuing manhunt for Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev the MBTA was fully shut down until the stay-inside request for Watertown, Cambridge, Belmont, and Boston was lifted. During the manhunt, MBTA buses were used to ferry police around the city. After the suspect was caught the MBTA resumed normal service. The next day the MBTA began displaying \"BOSTON STRONG\" and \"WE ARE ONE BOSTON\" on buses and subway cars, in addition to the destination that is normally displayed.\\n\\n\\n== MBTA operations and services ==\\n\\n\\n=== Buses ===\\n\\nThe MBTA bus system is the nation\\'s seventh largest by ridership and comprises over 150 routes across the Greater Boston area. The area served by the MBTA\\'s bus operations corresponds to that served by the subway, but is significantly smaller than that served by the MBTA\\'s commuter rail operation. Seven other regional transit authorities also provide bus services within that larger area, these being the Brockton Area Transit Authority, Cape Ann Transportation Authority, Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority, Lowell Regional Transit Authority, Merrimack Valley Regional Transit Authority, Montachusett Regional Transit Authority, and Worcester Regional Transit Authority. All of these authorities have their own fare structures and subcontract operation to private bus companies, but in many cases their buses serve as feeders to the MBTA commuter rail.\\n\\nWithin MBTA\\'s bus service area, transfers from the subway are free if using a CharlieCard (for local buses); transfers to the subway require paying the difference between bus and the higher subway fare (for local buses; if not using a CharlieCard, full subway fare must be paid in addition to full bus fare). Bus-to-bus transfers (for local buses) are free unless paying cash. Many of the outlying routes run express along major highways to downtown. The buses are colored yellow on maps and in station decor.\\nThe Silver Line is the MBTA\\'s first service designated as bus rapid transit (BRT), even though it lacks many of the characteristics of bus rapid transit. The first segment began operations in 2002, replacing the 49 bus, which in turn replaced the Washington Street Elevated section of the Orange Line. A full subway fare was charged, with free transfers to the subways downtown until January 1, 2007, when the fare system was revised to categorize the service as a \"bus\" for fare purposes. The \"Washington Street\" segment runs along various downtown streets, and mostly in dedicated bus lanes on Washington Street itself.\\n\\nThe \"Waterfront\" section opened at the end of 2004, and connects South Station to South Boston, partly via a tunnel and partly on the surface. These buses run dual-mode, trackless trolley in the tunnel and diesel bus outside. Service to Logan Airport began in June 2005. The Waterfront segment is classified as a \"subway\" for fare purposes. A transfer between segments is possible at South Station.\\nA \"Phase III\" tunneled segment was proposed to connect the two segments for through service, but it was controversial due to high cost and the fact that many did not consider Phase I to be adequate replacement service for the old Elevated. All Phase III tunneling proposals have been suspended due to lack of funds, as has the Urban Ring, which was intended to expand upon existing crosstown buses. However, improvements in crosstown bus services, including a new route to Chelsea, are still being planned and implemented.\\nThe MBTA contracts with private bus companies to provide subsidized service on certain routes outside of the usual fare structure. These are known collectively as the HI-RIDE Commuter Bus service, and are not numbered or mapped in the same way as integral bus services.\\nFour routes connecting to Harvard Station (Red Line) still run as trackless trolleys; there was once a much larger trackless trolley system. (See Trolleybuses in Greater Boston.)\\nIn FY2005, there were on average 363,500 weekday boardings of MBTA-operated buses and trackless trolleys (not including the Silver Line), or 31.8% of the MBTA system. Another 4,400 boardings (0.38%) occurred on subsidized bus routes operated by private carriers.\\n\\n\\n=== Subway ===\\n\\nThe subway system has three heavy rail rapid transit lines (the Red, Orange and Blue Lines), and two light rail lines (the Green Line and the Ashmont\\u2013Mattapan High Speed Line, the latter designated an extension of the Red Line). The system operates according to a spoke-hub distribution paradigm, with the lines running radially between central Boston and its environs. It is common usage in Boston to refer to all four of the color-coded rail lines which run underground as \"the subway\", regardless of the actual railcar equipment used.\\nAll four subway lines cross downtown, forming a quadrilateral configuration, and the Orange and Green Lines (which run approximately parallel in that district) also connect directly at two stations just north of downtown. The Red Line and Blue Line are the only pair of subway lines which do not have a direct transfer connection to each other. Because the various subway lines do not consistently run in any given compass direction, it is customary to refer to line directions as \"inbound\" or \"outbound\". Inbound trains travel towards the four downtown transfer stations, and outbound trains travel away from these hub stations.\\nAs of 22 March 2014, Government Center, one of the four hub transfer stations, is completely closed for major renovations expected to last two years. Green Line and Blue Line trains continue to run through the station, but no longer stop there, forcing passengers wishing to transfer between these two lines to use alternative connections. See the article on Government Center station for details.\\nThe Green Line has four branches in the west: \"B\" (Boston College), \"C\" (Cleveland Circle), \"D\" (Riverside), and \"E\" (Heath Street). The \"A\" Branch formerly went to Watertown, filling in the north-to-south letter assignment pattern, and the \"E\" Branch formerly continued beyond Heath Street to Arborway.\\nThe Red Line has two branches in the south\\u2014Ashmont and Braintree, named after their terminal stations.\\nThe colors were assigned on August 26, 1965 in conjunction with design standards developed by Cambridge Seven Associates, and have served as the primary identifier for the lines since the 1964 reorganization of the MTA into the MBTA. The Orange Line is so named because it used to run along Orange Street (now lower Washington Street); the Green Line because it runs adjacent to parts of the Emerald Necklace park system; the Blue Line because it runs under Boston Harbor; and the Red Line because its northernmost station used to be at Harvard University, whose school color is crimson.\\nThe four transit lines all use standard rail gauge, but are otherwise incompatible; trains of one line would have to be modified to run on another. Orange and Blue Line trains are similar enough that modification of some Blue Line trains for operation on the Orange Line was considered, although ultimately rejected for cost reasons. Also, some of the new Blue Line cars from Siemens Transportation were tested on the Orange Line after hours, before acceptance for revenue service on the Blue Line. There are no direct track connections between lines, except between the Red Line and Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line, but all except the Blue Line have little-used connections to the national rail network, which have been used for deliveries of railcars and supplies.\\nOpened in September 1897, the four-track-wide segment of the Green Line tunnel between Park Street and Boylston stations was the first subway in the United States, and has been designated a National Historic Landmark. The downtown portions of what are now the Green, Orange, Blue, and Red line tunnels were all in service by 1912. Additions to the rapid transit network occurred in most decades of the 1900s, and continue in the 2000s with the addition of Silver Line bus rapid transit and planned Green Line expansion. (See History and Future plans sections.)\\nIn FY2005, there were on average 628,400 weekday boardings on the rapid transit and light rail lines (including the Silver Line Bus Rapid Transit), or 55.0% of the MBTA system.\\nOn January 29, 2014, the MBTA completed a countdown clock display system, alerting passengers to arriving trains, at all 53 heavy rail subway stations (the Red, Blue and Orange Lines). The MBTA expects to introduce countdown clocks in Green Line stations by the end of 2014.\\n\\n\\n=== Commuter rail ===\\n\\nThe MBTA Commuter Rail system is a regional rail network that shares its tracks with inter-city passenger and freight trains. In 2007, the system was composed of twelve lines, three of which have branches, and another branch provides access to Gillette Stadium for special events in or near Foxborough. The rail network operates according to a spoke-hub distribution paradigm, with the lines running radially outward from the city of Boston. Eight of the lines converge at South Station, with four of these passing through Back Bay station. The other four converge at North Station. Amtrak runs intercity rail service over four lines: the Lake Shore Limited over the Worcester Line, Acela Express and Northeast Regional services over the Providence Line, and the Downeaster over sections of the Lowell Line and Haverhill Line. The Commuter Rail system has used the color purple on train cars and system maps since October 8, 1974, and consequently it is sometimes called the \"Purple Line.\"\\nThere is no passenger connection between the two sides. The opportunity for a North\\u2013South Rail Link, in association with the burying of the Central Artery in the Big Dig, was furthered by designing the Big Dig tunnel to permit the construction of a rail bed below the level of the automobile roadbeds. Passengers continue to take the Orange Line between Back Bay and North Station, or the Red and Orange, or Red and Green Lines between South and North stations, or take a bus or taxicab.\\nSeveral extensions are currently in planning or construction.\\nA south-side branch to Fall River and New Bedford is in the planning stages. Track exists to extend the Middleborough/Lakeville Line to restore passenger service to Cape Cod, formerly part of the Old Colony Railroad lines.\\nEach commuter rail line has up to eleven fare zones, numbered 1A and 1 through 10. Riders are charged based on the number of zones they travel through. Tickets can be purchased on the train, from ticket counters in some rail stations, from CharlieCard vendors in MBTA subway stations and other locations, and with a mobile app. If a local vendor is available, riders must purchase a ticket before boarding to avoid a surcharge. Fares range from $2.00 to $11.00, with multi-ride and monthly passes available. In FY2005, there were on average 135,900 weekday boardings, which was 11.9% of the MBTA system as a whole.\\nThe MBTA commuter rail network was the first in the nation to offer free Wi-Fi onboard trains. The MBTA recommends use of the service for simple web services. It offers wi-fi-enabled coaches on all train sets.\\n\\n\\n=== Ferries ===\\n\\nThe MBTA Boat system comprises several ferry routes via Boston Harbor. One of these is an inner harbor service, linking the downtown waterfront with the Boston Navy Yard in Charlestown. The other routes are commuter routes, linking downtown to Hingham, Hull, and Salem. Some commuter services operate via Logan International Airport.\\nAll boat services are operated by private sector companies under contract to the MBTA. In FY2005, the MBTA boat system carried 4,650 passengers (0.41% of total MBTA passengers) per weekday. The service is provided through contract of the MBTA by Boston Harbor Cruises (BHC) and Water Transportation Alternatives, Inc. (WTAI) under the name Boston\\'s Best Cruises.\\n\\n\\n=== Paratransit ===\\n\\nThe MBTA contracts out operation of \"The Ride\", an on-demand pickup and dropoff service for people with mobility challenges. Paratransit services carry 5,400 passengers on a typical weekday, or 0.47% of the MBTA system ridership. The three private service providers under contractual agreement with the MBTA for The Ride service are: Greater Lynn Senior Services (GLSS), Veterans Transportation LLC, and The Joint Venture of TTI/YCN, LLC.\\n\\n\\n=== Bicycles ===\\nConventional bicycles are generally allowed on MBTA commuter rail, commuter boat, and rapid transit lines during off-peak hours and all day on weekends and holidays. However, bicycles are not allowed at any time on the Green Line, or the Ashmont\\u2013Mattapan High Speed Line segment of the Red Line. Buses equipped with bike racks at the front (including the Silver Line) may always accommodate bicycles, up to the capacity limit of the racks. The MBTA claims that 95% of its buses are now equipped with bike racks, except for trackless trolleys which still lack this capability.\\nDue to congestion and tight clearances, bicycles are banned from Park Street, Downtown Crossing, and Government Center stations at all times.\\nHowever, compact folding bicycles are permitted on all MBTA vehicles at all times, provided that they are kept completely folded for the duration of the trip, including passage through faregates. Gasoline-powered vehicles, bike trailers, and Segways are prohibited.\\nNo special permit is required to take a bicycle onto an MBTA vehicle, but bicyclists are expected to follow the rules and hours of operation. Cyclists under 16 years old are supposed to be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Detailed rules, and an explanation of how to use front-of-bus bike racks and bike parking are on the MBTA website.\\nThe MBTA says that over 95% of its stations are equipped with bike racks, many of them under cover from the weather. In addition, over a dozen stations are equipped with \"Pedal & Park\" fully enclosed areas protected with video surveillance and controlled door access, for improved security. To obtain access, a personally registered CharlieCard must be used. Registration is done online, and requires a valid email address and the serial number of the CharlieCard. All bike parking is free of charge.\\n\\n\\n=== Parking ===\\nAs of 2014, the MBTA operates park and ride facilities at 103 locations with a total capacity of 55,000 automobiles, and is the owner of the largest number of off-street paid parking spaces in New England. The number of spaces at stations with parking varies from a few dozen to over 2,500. The larger lots and garages are usually near a major highway exit, and most lots fill up during the morning rush hour. There are some 22,000 spaces on the southern portion of the commuter rail system, 9,400 on the northern portion and 14,600 at subway stations. The parking fee ranges from $4 to $7 per day, and overnight parking (maximum 7 days) is permitted at some stations. Management for a number of parking lots owned by the MBTA is handled by LAZ Parking Limited, LLC.\\nCustomers parking in MBTA-owned and operated lots with existing cash \"honor boxes\" can pay for parking online or via phone while in their cars or once they board a train, bus, or commuter boat. As of February 2014, the MBTA switched from ParkMobile to PayByPhone as its provider for mobile parking payments by smartphone. Monthly parking permits are available, offering a modest discount. Detailed parking information by station is available online, including prices, estimated vacancy rate, and number of accessible and bicycle parking slots.\\nAs of 2014, the MBTA has a policy for electric vehicle charging stations in its parking spaces, but does not yet have such facilities available.\\n\\n\\n==== Zipcar ====\\nFrom time to time the MBTA has made various agreements with companies that contribute to commuting options. One company the MBTA selected was Zipcar; the MBTA provides Zipcar with a limited number of parking spaces at various subway stations throughout the system.\\n\\n\\n=== Hours of operation ===\\nTraditionally, the MBTA has stopped running around 1 am each night, despite the fact that bars and clubs in most areas of Boston are open until 2 am. Like nearly all subways worldwide, the MBTA\\'s subway does not have parallel express and local tracks, so much rail maintenance is only done when the trains are not running. An MBTA spokesperson has said, \"with a 109-year-old system you have to be out there every night\" to do necessary maintenance. The MBTA did experiment with \"Night Owl\" substitute bus service from 2001 to 2005, but abandoned it because of insufficient ridership, citing a $7.53 per rider cost to keep the service open, five times the cost per passenger of an average bus route.\\nA modified form of the MBTA\\'s previous \"Night Owl\" service was experimentally reinstated starting in the spring of 2014 \\u2014 this time, all subway lines were proposed to run until 3 am on weekends, along with the 15 most heavily used bus lines and the para-transit service \"The Ride\".\\nStarting March 28, 2014, the late-night service began operatation on a one-year trial basis, with service continuation depending on late-night ridership and on possible corporate sponsorship. As of August 2014, late-night ridership was stable, and much higher than the earlier failed experimental service. However, it is still unclear whether and on what basis the program might be extended past its first year. The extended hours program has not been implemented on the MBTA commuter rail operations.\\n\\n\\n== Passenger ridership ==\\nDuring Fiscal Year 2013, the entire MBTA system had a typical weekday passenger ridership of 1,297,650. The MBTA\\'s rapid transit lines (Red, Green, Orange, and Blue) accounted for 59% of all rides, buses accounted for 30%, and commuter rail accounted for 10% of all rides. The MBTA\\'s ferries and paratransit accounted for the remaining 1% of rides.\\nPassenger ridership has been steadily growing over the years, and between 2010 and 2013, the system saw passenger ridership grow 4.6% or an additional 57,000 daily passengers to the system.\\n\\n\\n=== Busiest stations ===\\nThe busiest stations in the MBTA system in 2013 were:\\nSouth Station - 25,100 daily passengers\\nDowntown Crossing - 23,500\\nHarvard - 23,200\\nPark Street - 19,700\\nBack Bay - 18,100\\nNorth Station - 17,100\\nCentral - 16,500\\nKendall/MIT - 15,400\\nForest Hills - 15,200\\nCopley - 14,000\\n\\n\\n== Public funding ==\\n\\n\\n=== Fares and fare collection ===\\n\\nThe MBTA has various fare structures for its various types of service. The CharlieCard electronic farecard is accepted on the subway and bus systems, but not on commuter rail, ferry, or paratransit services. Passengers pay for subway and bus rides at faregates in station entrances or fareboxes in the front of vehicles; MBTA employees manually check tickets on the commuter rail and ferries.\\nSince the 1980s, the MBTA has offered discounted monthly passes on all modes for the convenience of daily commuters and other frequent riders. One-day and seven-day passes, intended primarily for tourists, are available for buses, subway, and inner harbor ferries.\\nThe MBTA has periodically raised fares to match inflation and keep the system financially solvent. A substantial increase effective July 2012 raised public ire including an \"Occupy the MBTA\" protest. A transportation funding law passed in 2013 limits MBTA fare increases to 5% every two years. A 5% fare increase effective July 1, 2014 was implemented.\\n\\n\\n==== Subway and bus ====\\n\\nAs of 1 July 2014, all subway trips (Green Line, Blue Line, Orange Line, Red Line, Ashmont-Mattapan Line, and the Waterfront section of the Silver Line) cost $2.10 for CharlieCard holders and $2.65 for CharlieTicket or cash payers. Local bus and trackless trolley fares (including the Washington Street section of the Silver Line) are $1.60 for CharlieCard holders and $2.10 for others. All transfers between subway lines are free with all fare media. Passengers using CharlieCards can transfer free from a subway to a bus, and from a bus to a subway for the difference in price (\"step-up fare\"). CharlieTicket holders can transfer free between buses, but not between subway and bus, except between rapid transit and the Washington Street section of the Silver Line. Paying directly with cash is only available on buses, Green Line surface stops, and the Ashmont-Mattapan Line; a higher price is charged because it slows the process of boarding.\\nThe MBTA operates \"Inner Express\" and \"Outer Express\" buses to suburbs outside the subway system. Inner Express bus trips cost $3.65 with a CharlieCard or $4.75 without; Outer Express trips cost $5.25 with and $6.80 without. Free transfers are available to the subway and local buses with a CharlieCard, and to local buses with a CharlieTicket.\\nCharlieTickets are available from ticket vending machines in MBTA rapid transit stations. CharlieCards are not dispensed by the machines, but are available free of charge on request at most MBTA Customer Service booths in stations, or at the CharlieCard Store at Downtown Crossing station. As given out, the CharlieCards are \"empty\", and must have value added at an MBTA ticket machine before they can be used.\\nThe fare system, including on-board and in-station fare vending machines, was purchased from German-based Scheidt and Bachmann, which developed the technology. The CharlieCards were developed by Gemalto and later by Giesecke & Devrient. In 2006 electronic fares replaced metal tokens, which had been used on transit systems in Boston for over a century.\\nUntil 2007, not all subway fares were identical - passengers were not charged for boarding outbound Green Line trains at surface stops, while double fares were charged for the outer ends of the Green Line \"D\" Branch and the Red Line Braintree Branch. As part of a general fare hike effective January 1, 2007, the MBTA eliminated these inconsistent fares.\\n\\n\\n==== Commuter Rail ====\\n\\nCommuter rail fares are on a zone-based system, with fares dependent on the distance from downtown. Rides between Zone 1A stations - South Station, Back Bay, most of the Fairmount Line, and eight other stations within several miles of downtown - cost $2.10, the same as a subway fare with a CharlieCard. Fares for other stations range from $5.75 from Zone 1 (~5\\u201310 miles from downtown) to $14.50 from Zone 10 (~60 miles). All Massachusetts stations are Zone 8 or closer; only T.F. Green Airport and Wickford Junction in Rhode Island are Zone 9 and 10.\\nInterzone fares - for trips that do not go to Zone 1A - are offered at a substantial discount to encourage riders to take the commuter rail for less common commuting patterns for which transit is not usually taken. Discounted monthly passes are available for all trips; 10-ride passes at full price are also available for trips to Zone 1A. All monthly passes include unlimited trips on the subway and local bus; some outer-zone monthlies also offer free use of express buses and ferries. A cash-on-board surcharge of $3.00 is added for trips originating from stations with fare vending machines.\\n\\n\\n==== MBTA Boat ====\\nThe Inner Harbor Ferry costs $3.25 per ride, and is grouped as a Zone 1A monthly commuter rail pass. Single rides cost $8.50 from Hull or Hingham to Boston, $17.00 from Hull or Hingham to Logan Airport, and $13.75 from Boston to Logan Airport.\\n\\n\\n==== The Ride ====\\nFares on The Ride, the MBTA\\'s paratransit program, are structured differently from other modes. Passengers using The Ride must maintain an account with the MBTA in order to pay for service. Fares are $3.00 for \"ADA trips\" originating within 0.75 miles (1.21 km) of fixed-route bus or subway service and booked in advance, and $5.00 for \"premium trips\" booked the same day, or originating further away.\\n\\n\\n==== Discounted fares ====\\nDiscounted fares (As of 1 July 2014, $1.05 for the subway and $0.80 for local buses) as well as discounted monthly local bus and subway passes are available to seniors over 65, and passengers who are permanently disabled who utilize a special photo CharlieCard (called \"Senior ID\" and \"Transportation Access Pass\", respectively). Holders of these passes are also entitled to 50% off the Commuter Rail. Passengers who are legally blind ride for free on all MBTA services (including express buses and the Commuter Rail) with a Blind Access Card.\\nChildren 11 and under ride for free with an adult, and students aged 12\\u201317 receive a 50% discount on fares until 11 pm on school days. Student discounts require a Student CharlieCard issued through the holder\\'s school and is good until around the time when school vacation begins.\\n\\n\\n=== Budget ===\\nSince the \"forward funding\" reform in 2000, the MBTA is funded primarily through 16% of the state sales tax (with minimum dollar amount guarantee), which is set at 6.25% state-wide. The authority is also funded by passenger fares and formula assessments of the cities and towns in its service area (excepting those which are assessed for the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority). Supplemental income is obtained from its parking lots (reserved for passengers), renting space to retail vendors in and around stations, rents from utility companies using MBTA rights of way, selling surplus land and movable property, advertising on vehicles and properties, and federal operating subsidies for special programs.\\nThe FY2008 budget includes $1,037M for operating expenses and $374M in debt and lease payments.\\nThe Capital Investment Program is a rolling 5-year plan which programs capital expenses. The draft FY2009-2014 CIP allocates $3,795M, including $879M in projects funded from non-MBTA state sources (required for Clean Air Act compliance), and $299M in projects with one-time federal funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Capital projects are paid for by federal grants, allocations from the general budget of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (for legal commitments and expansion projects) and MBTA bonds (which are paid off through the operating budget).\\nThe FY2010 budget was supplemented by $160 million in sales tax revenue when the statewide rate was raised from 5% to 6.25%, to avoid service cuts or a fare increase in a year when deferred debt payments were coming due.\\n\\n\\n=== Capital improvements and planning process ===\\n\\nThe Boston Metropolitan Planning Organization is responsible for overall regional surface transportation planning. As required by federal law for projects to be eligible for federal funding (except earmarks), the MPO maintains a fiscally constrained 20+ year Regional Transportation Plan for surface transportation expansion, the current edition of which is called Journey to 2030. The required 4-year MPO plan is called the Transportation Improvement Plan.\\nThe MBTA maintains its own 25-year capital planning document, called the Program for Mass Transportation, which is fiscally unconstrained. The agency\\'s 4-year plan is called the Capital Improvement Plan; it is the primary mechanism by which money is actually allocated to capital projects. Major capital spending projects must be approved by the MBTA Board, and except for unexpected needs, are usually included in the initial CIP.\\nIn addition to federal funds programmed through the Boston MPO, and MBTA capital funds derived from fares, sales tax, municipal assessments, and other minor internal sources, the T receives funding from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for certain projects. The state may fund items in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) - such as the Big Dig mitigation projects - which is the plan required under the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution. (As of 2007, all of Massachusetts is designated as a clean air \"non-attainment\" zone.)\\nIn 2005, the administration of then-governor Mitt Romney announced a long range transportation plan that emphasized repair and maintenance over expansion.\\nDue to the financial constraints on the MBTA budget, it is expected that funds for all further expansion projects will be funded with money outside the MBTA\\'s budget. A state transportation bond bill is being used to fund the Green Line extension to Somerville and Medford, and planning for commuter rail service to Fall River and New Bedford.\\n\\n\\n=== Projects underway and future plans ===\\n\\n\\n==== Blue Line ====\\n\\nThere is a proposal to extend the Blue Line northward to Lynn, Massachusetts, with two potential extension routes having been identified. One proposed path would run through marshland alongside the existing Newburyport/Rockport commuter rail line, while the other would extend the line along the remainder of the BRB&L right of way.\\nIn addition, the MBTA has committed to designing an extension of the line\\'s southern terminus westward to Charles/MGH, where it would connect with the Red Line. This was one of the mitigation measures the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed to as part of the Big Dig.\\n\\n\\n==== Green Line ====\\n\\nTo settle a lawsuit with the Conservation Law Foundation to mitigate increased automobile emissions from the Big Dig, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed to extend the Green Line north to Somerville and Medford, two suburbs currently under-served by the MBTA. This plan, now under contract, starts at a relocated Lechmere Station, and terminates at College Avenue in Medford and Union Square in Somerville. The original settlement-imposed deadline was December 31, 2014. There will be an expected daily ridership of 8,420. On September 26, 2013, the MBTA awarded a $393 million contract to the joint venture of White, Skanska and Kiewit to build the second phase of the Green Line extension, bringing service to Union Square and Washington Street in Somerville. It is expected to serve passengers beginning in 2017.\\nAnother mitigation project in the initial settlement was restoration of service on the \"E\" Branch between Heath Street and Arborway/Forest Hills. A revised settlement agreement resulted in the substitution of other projects with similar air quality benefits. The state Executive Office of Transportation promised to consider other transit enhancements in the Arborway corridor.\\n\\n\\n==== Silver Line ====\\n\\nThe MBTA and MassDOT are building a new Silver Line route to Chelsea via East Boston and the Airport Blue Line station. Four new Silver Line stations will be built in Chelsea\\u2014Eastern Avenue, Box District, Downtown Chelsea and Mystic Mall. A new Chelsea commuter rail station and transit hub will be constructed at the terminus of the new Silver Line route. Service is expected to begin in 2017.\\nA planned Silver Line Phase III would have connected the two halves of the Silver Line via an underground busway from Boylston station on the Green Line to South Station. An initial proposed route involved a mile long tunnel connecting separate portals located at Charles and at Tremont streets. As of 2014, planning of the Phase III tunnel has been suspended indefinitely, without any physical construction having begun, due to funding difficulties and community opposition.\\n\\n\\n==== Urban Ring ====\\n\\nThe Urban Ring is a project of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, to develop new public transportation routes that would provide improved circumferential connections among many existing transit lines that project radially from downtown Boston, allowing easier travel between locations outside of downtown. The project corridor passes through various neighborhoods of Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Medford, Somerville, Cambridge, and Brookline. The capital cost for this version of the plan is estimated at $2.2 billion, with a projected daily ridership of 170,000. Fifty-three percent of the route is either in a bus-only lane, dedicated busway, or tunnel. The Urban Ring would have a higher collective ridership than the Orange Line, Blue Line, or the entire commuter rail system.\\n\\n\\n==== Commuter rail ====\\n\\nThere are several proposed extensions to current commuter rail lines. A controversial extension of the Stoughton Line is proposed to serve Fall River, and New Bedford. Critics argue that building the extension does not make economic sense.\\nA 20-mile (32 km) extension of the Providence Line past Providence to T. F. Green Airport and Wickford Junction in Rhode Island opened in 2012. The Rhode Island Department of Transportation is also studying the feasibility of serving existing Amtrak stations in Kingston and Westerly as well as constructing new stations in Cranston, East Greenwich, and West Davisville. Federal funding has also been provided for preliminary planning of a new station in Pawtucket.\\nIn September 2009, CSX Transportation and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts finalized a $100 million agreement to purchase CSX\\'s Framingham to Worcester tracks, as well as some other track, to improve service on the Framingham/Worcester Line. A liability issue that had held up the agreement was resolved. There is also a plan to upgrade the Fitchburg Line to have cab signaling and to construct a second track along a 7-mile (11 km) run near Acton which is shared with freight traffic, so that the Fitchburg to Boston trip will be able to take only about an hour.\\nThe state of New Hampshire created the New Hampshire Rail Transit Authority and allocated money to build platforms at Nashua and Manchester. An article in The Eagle-Tribune claimed that Massachusetts was negotiating to buy property which has the potential to extend the Haverhill Line to Plaistow, New Hampshire.\\nMassachusetts agreed in 2005 to make improvements on the Fairmount Line part of its legally binding commitment to mitigate increased air pollution from the Big Dig. These improvements, including four new infill stations, were supposed to be complete by December 31, 2011. The total cost of the project was estimated at $79.4 million, and it was expected to divert 220 daily trips from automobiles to transit. As of March 2014, three of the new stations were open; the fourth station has been delayed by community opposition. In 2014, the MBTA announce it would purchase Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) self-propelled rail cars for the Fiarmount Line with eventual expansion to five other lines to be known as the Indigo Line.\\nNo direct rail connection exists between North Station and South Station, effectively splitting the commuter rail network into separate pieces. A North\\u2013South Rail Link has been proposed to unite the two halves of the commuter rail system, to allow more convenient and efficient through-routed service. However because of high cost, Massachusetts withdrew its sponsorship of the proposal in 2006, in communications with the United States Department of Transportation. Advocacy groups continue to press for the project as a better alternative than expanding South Station, which would also be costly but provide fewer overall improvements in service.\\n\\n\\n== Management and administration ==\\nThe MBTA has a board of directors which it shares with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. The Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation leads the executive management team of MassDOT in addition to serving in the Governor\\'s Cabinet. The MBTA\\'s executive management team is led by its General Manager, who is currently also serving as the MassDOT Rail and Transit Administrator, overseeing all public transit in the state.\\nThe MBTA Advisory Board represents the cities and towns in the MBTA service district. The municipalities are assessed a total of $143M annually (as of FY2008). In return, the Advisory Board has veto power over the MBTA operating and capital budgets, including the power to reduce the overall amount.\\n\\n\\n=== Key people ===\\n\\n\\n=== Major facilities and offices ===\\nThe MBTA\\'s buses are maintained and stored at several bus garages located throughout eastern Massachusetts:\\nAlbany Street, South End\\nCabot Garage, South Boston\\nArborway, Jamaica Plain\\nBartlett Garage (defunct, replaced by Arborway), Roxbury\\nCharlestown Garage (two conjoined garages)\\nEverett Main Repair Facility (also known as Everett Shops)\\nFellsway Garage, Medford\\nLynn Garage\\nNorth Cambridge(trolley-buses only)\\nSouthampton Street Garage, South Boston (Silver Line, routes 28 and 39)\\nQuincy Garage\\nRail lines have their own maintenance facilities:\\nBlue Line: Orient Heights Yard\\nGreen Line: Riverside Yard and Reservoir Yard\\nOrange Line: Wellington Yard\\nRed Line: Cabot Yard\\nMajor administrative facilities:\\n10 Park Plaza (State Transportation Building), Boston\\n45 High Street, Boston\\nMBTA Transit Police: 240 Southampton Street, Boston\\nSenior & Transportation Access Pass (TAP) / Disability Office: CharlieCard Store, Downtown Crossing Station concourse (near Arch Street exit), Boston\\nCustomer Service Window: CharlieCard Store, Downtown Crossing Station concourse, Boston\\nRevenue Operations: 32 Alford Street, Charlestown\\n\\n\\n=== Employees and unions ===\\nAs of 2009, the MBTA employs 6,346 workers, of which roughly 600 are in part-time jobs.\\nStructurally, the employees of the MBTA function as part of a handful of trade unions. The largest union of the MBTA is the Carmen\\u2019s Union (Local 589), representing bus and subway operators. This includes full and part-time bus drivers, motorpersons and streetcar motorpersons, full and part-time train attendants, and Customer Service Agents (CSAs). Further unions include the Machinists Union, Local 264; Electrical Workers Union, Local 717; the Welder\\'s Union, Local 651; the Executive Union; the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 453; the Professional and Technical Engineers Union, Local 105; and the Office and Professional Employees Union, Local 6.\\nWithin the authority, employees are ranked according to seniority (or \"rating\"). This is categorized by an employee\\'s five-digit badge number, though some of the longest serving employees still have only four-digits. An employee\\'s badge number indicates the relative length of employment with the MBTA; badges are issued in sequential order. The rating structure determines many different things, including the rank in which perks are to be offered to employee, such as: When offering the choice for quarter-annual route assignments (\"picks\"), overtime offerings, and even the rank to transfer new hires from part-time roles to a full-time role.\\n\\n\\n=== Law enforcement and security ===\\n\\nThe MBTA maintains its own police force which actively patrols all areas and vehicles used by the Authority. MBTA Police conduct routine vehicle patrol, routine foot patrol, incident investigations, and specialized patrol with K-9 dogs, and other specialized methods of explosive and narcotics detection.\\nThe MBTA also maintains several closed-circuit television facilities located throughout its service area. The cameras monitor various areas including trains stations, and MBTA vehicles throughout the system on a 24-hour basis. MBTA phone numbers pasted onto the front of the fare gates can place customers having a problem directly into contact with one of these operations centers.\\n\\n\\n== Criticism ==\\n\\n\\n=== Fares and financial issues ===\\nAhead of the MBTA\\'s 2009 restructuring with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT), the MBTA had a total debenture of over US$8 billion. As a direct result, MBTA fares and parking fees have increased significantly. In July 2009, the MBTA proposed a 20% fare increase and significant service cuts. The MBTA has endured criticism that the increases have outpaced inflation.\\n\\n\\n=== Rail vs. bus service ===\\nWhen the Orange Line was rebuilt in the 1980s, it was rerouted from deteriorating elevated railway structures to instead follow existing rail right-of-way, to greatly reduce land acquisition and construction costs. This had the side effect of changing its course away from the lower income areas of Everett, Chelsea, and Roxbury (where residents are less likely to own cars, and depend more on public transit), toward the more affluent towns of Malden and Medford, as well as sections of the Jamaica Plain neighborhood (where car ownership is higher, and thus, reliance on public transit is far lower).\\nTo mitigate this, the MBTA set up a new bus line served by articulated buses equipped with specialized dispatching equipment, and a few of the features of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) route. The MBTA named this new service the Silver Line, and classified it as though it were a high-capacity rail transit service, though it fails to meet full service standards for a BRT route. The Silver Line service has been criticized in many respects, most notably for its slow speed and the fact that it operates in mixed street traffic, subject to gridlock and collisions, earning it the nickname \"Silver Lie\" among some critics. A rating from the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) determined that the MBTA Silver Line was best classified as \"Not BRT\" after local decision makers gradually decided to do away with most BRT-specific features.\\n\\n\\n=== Radial vs. circumferential routes ===\\n\\nTransportation advocates in Boston have complained that rail transit riders cannot travel from one outlying area to another without first traveling to the downtown hub stations, changing lines, and traveling outbound again. Some of the radial transit lines, notably the Green Line, are so overcrowded that service is very slow, unreliable, and capacity-limited because of rush-hour \"crush loads\". There are several crosstown bus lines, such as the #1, #66, CT1, CT2, and CT3 routes, but they are slow, unreliable, and subject to bus bunching because they must operate in mixed street traffic.\\nThe MBTA Urban Ring Project would provide faster and more reliable circumferential service, and relieve overcrowding in the downtown hub stations. This issue has been studied as early as 1972, in the Boston Transportation Planning Review, and has been in detailed planning stages since before 2000, but has only been partially implemented due to lack of funding. A similar problem also occurs in the Washington Metro system, where customers cannot travel between suburbs on the same side of Washington without going through downtown, and Chicago\\'s Metra and CTA systems, where all lines lead into and out of the central business district, rather than around it.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n\\n=== Official ===\\nMBTA official site\\nKeolis Commuter Services\\n\\n\\n=== Capital projects ===\\nOfficial EOT/MBTA Transit Commitment documents\\nState Transportation Improvement Plan (STIP)\\nOfficial Green Line extension website\\nOfficial South Coast Rail website\\n\\n\\n=== History ===\\nHistory of the MBTA (official)\\nTransitHistory Discussion of the MBTA, Greater Boston Transit and national transit.\\nBoston Street Railway Association Boston-based historical organization.\\nMBTA history (archived 2007)\\nnycsubway.org \\u2014 Boston Transit: The MBTA (station by station history and photographs)\\nBoston Elevated-Subway and Tunnel System Map, 1934 - Collection of the City Record and Boston News-Letter\\n\\n\\n=== Other ===\\nMBTA Vehicle Inventory\\nStatistics and video tours of the MBTA', u'Golf World': u'Golf World is a weekly magazine covering the game of golf published by Cond\\xe9 Nast.

When World War II began, Soul\\xe9 and the Pavillon chef Pierre Franey stayed in the United States as war refugees.\\nThe restaurant formally opened on October 15, 1941 at 5 East 55th Street on Fifth Avenue across the street from the St. Regis Hotel.\\nSoul\\xe9 died in 1966, and Le Pavillon closed in 1971.\\nIn his autobiography, , Jacques P\\xe9pin describes how he was first employed at Le Pavilion after emigrating to the USA in 1959. He found that Franey and the rest of the staff were underpaid and treated poorly by Soul\\xe9, who insisted that he was barely making ends meet, even though he would offer complimentary meals and wine to a large number of celebrity guests. When P\\xe9pin and others organized a protest, he found himself physically threatened by organized-crime goons. However, there was soon an exodus of the staff (Franey and P\\xe9pin moved to Howard Johnson\\'s) and the restaurant never recovered. Soul\\xe9\\'s other faux pas was allowing paparazzi to disturb the Kennedy family (who were regular customers) and their staffers during John F. Kennedy\\'s Presidential campaign: when the Kennedy team, who was dining at the restaurant, asked the paparazzi to leave, Soul\\xe9 insisted that only he had the right, as owner, to determine who entered and left the restaurant, and stated that, even before the election, \"the Kennedys already think they are running the country.\" (P\\xe9pin was offered the job of White House chef after the election, but declined.)\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nProfile of restaurant\\nNew Yorker profile\\nNew York Times profile\\nUS News Profile', u'National Register of Historic Places listings in Saratoga County, New York': u'List of the National Register of Historic Places listings in Saratoga County, New York\\nThis is intended to be a complete list of properties and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Saratoga County, New York.

The Fon language is the main language spoken in Southern Benin, and is a member of the Gbe language group. The Fon are said to originate from Tado, a village in south east Togo, near the border with Benin.\\nMost Fon today live in villages and small towns in mud houses with corrugated iron gable roofs. Cities built by the Fon include Abomey, the historical capital city of Dahomey, and Ouidah on the Slave Coast. These cities were major commercial centres for the slave trade.\\n\\n\\n== Origin ==\\nAccording to oral tradition, the Fon of Benin are descendants of the Aja people. According to them, between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries some of the Aja people, originating from Tado, a village in south east Togo, to the banks of the Mono River, emigrated to the eastern part of its territory, now Benin, and founded the town of Allada. Later Ajas from Allada established a new state: Great Ardra, in which kings ruled with the consent of the village elders. Allada became the capital of Great Ardra.\\nIn c.1625, a dispute occurred between the three sons of the king, based in the succession to his father as king of Great Ardra. This dispute divided the kingdom into three parts: one brother, Kokpon, retained Great Ardra. Another brother, Do-Aklin, founded the city of Abomey, and the third, Te-Agdanlin, founded the city of Ajatche or Little Ardra (also called Porto-Novo by Portuguese traders who traded there). The Aja residents in Abomey slowly mixed with the local tribes, thus causing the \"Fon\" people.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe Fon founded the Kingdom of Dahomey around 1600. During the early 17th century, the King of Dahomey, Agaja (reigned 1708-1732), conquered most of the current area of southern Benin (except Porto-Novo), to establish direct contact with European traders. It was during these years that Dahomey used women as soldiers for the first time. The expansion funds for most of that territory led to a feud between Dahomey and the Yoruba people of the kingdom of Oyo, causing caused a conflict between them. Thus the king captured Abomey in 1738 and he forced Dahomey to pay an annual tribute until 1818. During this time, the Fon of Dahomey conquered Yoruba cities, selling prisoners of war to the Portuguese. As a result, in the last decades of the nineteenth century many Yoruba were transported to the Americas, and they left their cultural footprints in Cuba and Brazil. Also as a result of the wars between Dahomey and Oyo, Dahomey continued to expand northward, further amplifying the slave trade, despite the efforts exerted by Britain to stop the trade. These wars were fueled by some Europeans to stimulate trade in slaves and weapons. As a major West African slave state, Dahomey became extremely unpopular with neighboring peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\nThe culture is patrilineal and allows polygamy and divorce. Funerals (and anniversaries of deaths) are among the most important cultural events, with mourning activities, including drumming and dancing, often lasting for days. The Fon believe that part of the person dies and part is reincarnated.\\nAccording to Herskovits (1938), the Fon have patriclans, but each woman in a polygynous family has her own home within the \"compound\" where she lives with her children. In villages men form work teams to work the land in common. This system is called \"dokpwe\" and is reminiscent of Venezuelan \"cayapas\".\\n\\n\\n== Fon religion ==\\n\\nWhile many Fon identify as Christian, the majority practice Benin\\'s national religion Vodun. The Fon name for a god or spirit is \"Vodu\". The Supreme Being of the Fon is Mawu-Lisa. The Pantheon is structured almost as among the Yoruba people. There are also sects of followers for each deity (Vodou). There are telluric and celestial gods, nature spirits and water. There are priests and mediums who receive the spirits on the occasion of the great festivals. The cult of the sacred serpents in the temple of Whydah had some importance, but eventually fell into disuse. Practice can involve drumming to induce possession by one of these gods or spirits. Fon religion is polytheistic, with a supreme (but not omnipotent) deity known as Nana Buluku.\\n\\n\\n== Fons in the slave trade ==\\nThe kings of Dahomey sold their war captives into transatlantic slavery, captives who would otherwise have been killed in a ceremony known as the Annual Customs. The empire traded with Europeans from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, reaching its great economic boom to the late eighteenth century because of the slave trade. In the eighteenth century, the Empire invaded Arda and Whydah, export ports of many slaves. Thus, export ports were Arda, Whydah and Porto Novo (current Benin), and Badagry and Lagos (Nigeria) (Lachataure, 1961: 5). In the Juan Liscano historian\\xb4s opinion, before of 1700 the Fon of Whydah, Dahomey, sold to European traders members of the following tribes (Liscano, 1950: 74 s): Wida, Popo, Adja (residents in southeastern Togo and Benin southeast), Ketou (perhaps the city of the same name in Benin), Ewe and Mahi (residents in Abomey, the old capital of Dahomey Empire). Since 1700, they sold to European traders many Yorubas.\\n\\n\\n== Fon influence in the New World ==\\n\\nWhether by part of empire of Dahomey by itself or their enemy states, many Fon slaves were sold to European traders, who exported to Americas. So, many descendants of the Fon now live in the Americas as a result of the Atlantic slave trade. Together with other cultural groups from the Fon homeland region such as the Yoruba and Bantu, Fon culture merged with French, Portuguese or Spanish to produce distinct religions (Voodoo, Mami Wata, Candombl\\xe9 and Santer\\xeda), dance and musical styles (Arar\\xe1, Yan Valu).\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nDahomey Amazons', u'List of Chicago Bears award winners': u'The Chicago Bears are an American football franchise currently playing in the National Football League.

Under most jurisdictions the fundamental banking activities, such as taking deposits from the general public are exclusive to holders of a banking license. A non-banking financial company is an institution that provides financial services without meeting the legal definition of a bank, such as holding a banking license.\\n\\n\\n== License issuance ==\\nLicenses are typically issued by the banking regulatory body in which the bank is established. There is a relatively long and complicated procedure that goes into the application. This procedure will also depend on the type of bank license that you wish to apply for. Licensing is generally broken down into different categories, while each category has a different specialization, and a different time frame involved in the banking license application process.\\nDue to the number of different sectors in which banks may be involved, there are also bank licensing packages available. The main bank license is the one that allows the bank to engage in all of the activities that one would expect a major bank to partake in, including retail banking, merchant acquiring, cash management, asset management and trading. Obtaining a bank license that allows you to engage in all of these activities will generally take the longest, and cost the most. Additionally, however, you can apply for one that has fewer or even only one specialization.\\n\\n\\n== Banking licenses in the United States ==\\nMost state legislatures in the United States ban general corporations from accepting banker\\'s deposits, which ban tends to cover any service whereby a general corporation acts as a funds drawee which transfers current funds (i.e. credit payable upon demand) to make payments as a substitute for coins on behalf of an accountholder. Historically, in some states, this ban did not extend to a sole proprietor acting as a banker.\\nOne argument for justifying the policy of requiring banking licenses under the US Constitution is that bankers credit sometimes interferes with the regulation of the value of coins, and therefore it is necessary and proper to make laws which regulate banking.\\nUS states tend to include a license to conduct the business of banking as part of the standard terms of the corporate franchise in the state bank charters of incorporation. The license may be implied by a reference in the charter application to the bank being created \"under\" the state banking law. Federal depository institutions, such as National Banks, or federally-chartered credit unions derive their authority from federal statutory charter law. Opening or operating a bank also requires regulatory compliance, which may include FDIC approval for coverage and opening an account at a Federal Reserve Bank (or otherwise establishing a facility to settle checks via settlement with Federal Reserve Bank issued credit).\\nIf a bank wishes to perform any substantial fiduciary services, such as trust department services, or acting as a securities holding intermediary, then the bank must apply for an additional special license for trust powers. Depending on the specifics of the bank charter, these licenses are available variously from FDIC, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, or State regulators. Another option for such a bank is to create a State-chartered Trust Company and hold it as a subsidiary corporation.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nFinance\\n\\n\\n== References ==', u'Ijaw people': u'Ijaw (also known by the subgroups \"Ijo\" or \"Izon\") are a collection of peoples indigenous mostly to the forest regions of the Bayelsa, Delta, and Rivers States within the Niger Delta in Nigeria. Some are resident in Akwa-Ibom, Edo, and Ondo states also in Nigeria. Many are found as migrant fishermen in camps as far west as Sierra Leone and as far east as Gabon along the Western Africa coastline.\\nThe Ijo population count is an estimated 3.4 million. They have long lived in locations near many sea trade routes, and they were well connected to other areas by trade as early as the 15th century. The current President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, is an Ijaw.\\n\\n\\n== Language ==\\n\\nThe Ijaw speak nine closely related Niger\\u2013Congo languages, all of which belong to the Ijoid branch of the Niger\\u2013Congo tree. The primary division between the Ijo languages is that between Eastern Ijo and Western Ijo, the most important of the former group of languages being Izon, which is spoken by about four million people.\\nThere are two prominent groupings of the Izon language. The first, termed either Western or Central Izon (Ijaw) consists of Western Ijaw speakers: Ekeremor, Sagbama (Mein), Bassan, Apoi, Arogbo, Boma (Bumo), Kabo (Kabuowei), Ogboin, Tarakiri, and Kolokuma-Opokuma (Yenagoa). Nembe, Brass and Akassa (Akaha) dialects represent Southeast Ijo (Izon).. Buseni and Okordia dialects are considered Inland Ijo.\\nThe other major Ijaw linguistic group is Kalabari. Kalabari is considered an Eastern Ijaw language but the term \"Eastern Ijaw\" is not the normal nomenclature. Kalabari is the name of one of the Ijaw clans that reside on the eastern side of the Niger-Delta (Abonnema, Buguma, Bakana, Degema etc.) who form a major group in Rivers State, hence their involvement in the fight for greater oil control. Other \"Eastern\" Ijaw clans are the Okrika, Ibani (the natives of Bonny, Finima and Opobo) and Nkoroo. They are neighbours to the Kalabari people in present day Rivers State, Nigeria.\\nOther related Ijaw subgroups which have distinct languages but very close kinship, cultural and territorial ties with the rest of the Ijaw are the Epie-Atissa, Engenni (also known as \\u1eb8g\\u1eb9n\\u1eb9), and Degema (also called Udekama or Udekaama). These groups speak Delta Edoid languages. The Ogbia clan, Andoni people, as well as residents of Bukuma and Abuloma (Obulom) speak Cross River languages.\\nIt was discovered in the 1980s that a nearly extinct Berbice Creole Dutch, spoken in Guyana, is partly based on Ijo lexicon and grammar. Its nearest relative seems to be Eastern Ijo, most likely Kalabari (Kouwenberg 1994).\\n\\n\\n== Origin ==\\nTheir settlement in the delta was from the earliest of times. Unfortunately not much is known about this period, only that traditionally it is said that these early ancestors \\u201cdropped from the sky\\u201d (i.e. to say the Orus were of divine origin), and were devotees of a spiritual culture that made much use of the waters (hence the mermaid and water people legends \\u201cBeni-Otu\\u201d) They were later to be joined by other ancestors \\u201cKumoni-Orus\\u201d from about 400 CE, and 650 CE (AD), who, after settling first in the Nupe and Borgu regions, then the Ile-Ife region, moved to the Benin region via Nupe, and Ife. In the Benin region they eventually settled and launched expeditions into the Niger Delta, where they came across remote settlements of the Orus, whom they termed \\u201cancient people\\u201d. But because they were also ultimately Oru, from the beginning they established communities as one people. The Ijos were known by the two names of Kumoni or Oru up till the time of the 19th century. European visitors noted the name Oru as a distinct term for Ijaw. Likewise the compilers of the Izon/English dictionary noted that \\u201cto speak Kumoni is to speak pure Izon language\\u201d. The term Ijo (Ijaw) or Izon evolved as the name of the whole ethnic nationality through time, even though as a personal name it derived from one ancestor who was known as Ujo, whom as we have previously mentioned, represents the time when the Ijos evolved as a distinct separate people from their neighbours.\\n\\n\\n== Tribes ==\\nThe Ijaw ethnic group consists of 50 loosely affiliated tribes. These clans are based along kinship lines and/or shared cultural and religious traditions.\\n\\n\\n== Traditional occupations ==\\n\\nThe Ijaw were one of the first of Nigeria\\'s peoples to have contact with Westerners, and were active as go-betweens in the slave trade between visiting Europeans and the peoples of the interior, particularly in the era before the discovery of quinine, when West Africa was still known as the \"White Man\\'s Graveyard\" because of the endemic presence of malaria. Some of the kin-based trading lineages that arose among the Ijaw developed into substantial corporations which were known as \"houses\"; each house had an elected leader as well as a fleet of war canoes for use in protecting trade and fighting rivals. The other main occupation common among the Ijaw has traditionally been fishing and farming.\\nBeing a maritime people, many Ijaws were employed in the merchant shipping sector in the early and mid-20th century (pre-Nigerian independence). With the advent of oil and gas exploration in their territory, some are employed in that sector. Other main occupation are in the civil service of the Nigerian states of Bayelsa and Rivers where they are predominant.\\nExtensive state-government sponsored overseas scholarship programs in the 1970s and 1980s have also led to a significant presence of Ijaw professionals in Europe and North America (so-called Ijaw diaspora). Another contributing factor to this human capital flight is the abject poverty in their homeland of the Niger Delta, resulting from decades of neglect by the Nigerian government and oil companies in spite of continuous petroleum prospecting in this region since the 1950s.\\n\\n\\n== Lifestyle ==\\nThe Ijaw people live by fishing supplemented by farming paddy-rice, plantains, yams, cocoyams, bananas and other vegetables as well as tropical fruits such as guava, mangoes and pineapples; and trading. Smoke-dried fish, timber, palm oil and palm kernels are processed for export. While some clans (those to the east- Akassa, Nembe, Kalabari, Okrika and Bonny) had powerful chiefs and a stratified society, other clans are believed not to have had any centralized confederacies until the arrival of the British. However, owing to influence of the neighbouring Kingdom of Benin individual communities even in the western Niger Delta also had chiefs and governments at the village level.\\nMarriages are completed by the payment of a bridal dowry, which increases in size if the bride is from another village (so as to make up for that village\\'s loss of her children). Funeral ceremonies, particularly for those who have accumulated wealth and respect, are often very dramatic. Traditional religious practices center around \"Water spirits\" in the Niger river, and around tribute to ancestors.\\n\\n\\n== Religion and cultural practices ==\\nAlthough the Ijaw are now primarily Christians (95% profess to be), with Roman Catholicism and Anglicanism being the varieties of Christianity most prevalent among them, they also have elaborate traditional religious practices of their own. Veneration of ancestors plays a central role in Ijaw traditional religion, while water spirits, known as Owuamapu figure prominently in the Ijaw pantheon. In addition, the Ijaw practice a form of divination called Igbadai, in which recently deceased individuals are interrogated on the causes of their death.\\nIjaw religious beliefs hold that water spirits are like humans in having personal strengths and shortcomings, and that humans dwell among the water spirits before being born. The role of prayer in the traditional Ijaw system of belief is to maintain the living in the good graces of the water spirits among whom they dwelt before being born into this world, and each year the Ijaw hold celebrations in honor the spirits lasting for several days. Central to the festivities is the role of masquerades, in which men wearing elaborate outfits and carved masks dance to the beat of drums and manifest the influence of the water spirits through the quality and intensity of their dancing. Particularly spectacular masqueraders are taken to actually be in the possession of the particular spirits on whose behalf they are dancing.\\nThe Ijaw are also known to practice ritual acculturation (enculturation), whereby an individual from a different, unrelated group undergoes rites to become Ijaw. An example of this is Jaja of Opobo, the Igbo slave who rose to become a powerful Ibani (Bonny) chief in the 19th century.\\nThere are also a small number of Converts to Islam the most notable being the founder of the Delta People Volunteer Force, Mujahid Dokubo-Asari.\\n\\n\\n== Food customs ==\\nLike many ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Ijaws have many local foods that are not widespread in Nigeria. Many of these foods involve fish and other seafoods such as clams, oysters and periwinkles; yams and plantains. Some of these foods are:\\nPolofiyai \\u2014 A very rich soup made with yams and palm oil\\nKekefiyai\\u2014 A pottage made with chopped unripened (green) plantains, fish, other seafood or game meat (\"bushmeat\") and palm oil\\nFried or roasted fish and plantain \\u2014 Fish fried in palm oil and served with fried plantains\\nGbe \\u2014 The grub of the raffia-palm tree beetle that is eaten raw, dried, fried in groundnut oil or pickled in palm oil\\nKalabari \"sea-harvest\" fulo\\u2014 A rich mixed seafood soup or stew that is eaten with foofoo, rice or yams\\n\\n\\n== Ethnic identity ==\\nFormerly organized into several loose clusters of villages (confederacies) which cooperated to defend themselves against outsiders, the Ijaw increasingly view themselves as belonging to a single coherent nation, bound together by ties of language and culture. This tendency has been encouraged in large part by what are considered to be environmental degradations that have accompanied the exploitation of oil in the Niger delta region which the Ijaw call home, as well as by a revenue sharing formula with the Nigerian Federal government that is viewed by the Ijaw as manifestly unfair. The resulting sense of grievance has led to several high-profile clashes with the Nigerian Federal authorities, including kidnappings and in the course of which many lives have been lost.\\n\\n\\n== Ijaw-Itsekiri conflicts ==\\n\\nOne manifestation of ethnic violence on the part of the Ijaw has been an increase in the number and severity of clashes between Ijaw militants and those of Itsekiri origin, particularly in the town of Warri.\\n\\n\\n== Oil conflict ==\\n\\nThe December 1998 All Ijaw Youths Conference crystallized the struggle with the formation of the Ijaw Youth Movement (IYM) and the issuing of the Kaiama Declaration. In it, long-held Ijaw concerns about the loss of control of their homeland and their own lives to the oil companies were joined with a commitment to direct action. In the declaration, and in a letter to the companies, the Ijaws called for oil companies to suspend operations and withdraw from Ijaw territory. The IYM pledged \\u201cto struggle peacefully for freedom, self-determination and ecological justice,\\u201d and prepared a campaign of celebration, prayer, and direct action \\'Operation Climate Change\\' beginning December 28, 1998.\\nIn December 1998, two warships and 10-15,000 Nigerian troops occupied Bayelsa and Delta states as the Ijaw Youth Movement (IYM) mobilized for Operation Climate Change. Soldiers entering the Bayelsa state capital of Yenagoa announced they had come to attack the youths trying to stop the oil companies. On the morning of December 30, 1998, two thousand young people processed through Yenagoa, dressed in black, singing and dancing. Soldiers opened fire with rifles, machine guns, and tear gas, killing at least three protesters and arresting twenty-five more. After a march demanding the release of those detained was turned back by soldiers, three more protesters were shot dead including Nwashuku Okeri, Ghadafi Ezeifile and Onwinkron Ibe. The head of Yenagoa rebels- Chief Onwinkron Ibe- was burned alive in his mansion on December 28, 1998. Amongst his family members to flee the premises before complete ruins was his only son, Desmond Ibe. The military declared a state of emergency throughout Bayelsa state, imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew, and banned meetings. At military roadblocks, local residents were severely beaten or detained. At night, soldiers invaded private homes, terrorizing residents with beatings and women and girls with rape.\\nOn January 4, 1999 about one hundred soldiers from the military base at Chevron\\u2019s Escravos facility attacked Opia and Ikiyan, two Ijaw communities in Delta State. Bright Pablogba, the traditional leader of Ikiyan, who came to the river to negotiate with the soldiers, was shot along with a seven-year-old girl and possibly dozens of others. Of the approximately 1,000 people living in the two villages, four people were found dead and sixty-two were still missing months after the attack. The same soldiers set the villages ablaze, destroyed canoes and fishing equipment, killed livestock, and destroyed churches and religious shrines.\\nNonetheless, Operation Climate Change continued, and disrupted Nigerian oil supplies through much of 1999 by turning off valves through Ijaw territory. In the context of high conflict between the Ijaw and the Nigerian Federal Government (and its police and army), the military carried out the Odi massacre, killing scores if not hundreds of Ijaws.\\nRecent actions by Ijaws against the oil industry have included both renewed efforts at nonviolent action and militarized attacks on oil installations but with no human casualties to foreign oil workers despite hostage-takings. These attacks are usually in response to non-fulfilment by oil companies of memoranda of understanding with their host communities.\\n\\n\\n== Ijaw organizations ==\\nAndoni Forum USA (AFUSA)\\nIjaw Youth Council\\nIjaw National Congress\\nIjaw Elders Forum\\nIjaw Youth Congress\\nCongress of Niger Delta Youths\\nNational Union of Izon-Ebe Students\\nSagbama Youth Movement\\nEkine Sekiapu Ogbo\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch, \\u201cDelta Crackdown,\\u201d May 1999\\nIjaw Youth Movement, letter to \\u201cAll Managing Directors and Chief Executives of transnational oil companies operating in Ijawland,\\u201d December 18, 1998\\nProject Underground, \"Visit the World of Chevron: Niger Delta\", 1999\\nKari, Ethelbert Emmanuel. 2004.

It is the CTA\\'s second busiest rail line, with an average of 186,796 passengers boarding each weekday in September 2012. The route\\'s full length is 34.6 miles (55.7 km) with a total of 33 stations.\\nThe Blue Line and Red Line are the only two routes of the CTA rail system to currently run 24 hours a day, and is one of only six mass-transit rail lines in the United States to do so (the others being the PATCO Speedline, Staten Island Railway, the PATH lines, certain lines of Minneapolis-St. Paul\\'s METRO, and the majority of the New York City Subway\\'s routes). Service between O\\'Hare and 54th/Cermak no longer operates. The Pink Line now serves all stations on the 54th/Cermak branch. The Blue Line is also one of only two lines with more than one station with the same name, with the Green Line being the other (It has two Harlem stations: one in the Kennedy Expressway on the Northwest side, and one on the south side of the Eisenhower Expressway on the West Side. It also has two Western stations: one on the Milwaukee Elevated and one on the Congress branch). The Blue Line also has only three in-system \\'L\\' train transfers (all in the downtown area), contains a combination of both the oldest and newest portions of \\'L\\' tracks, and is the sole line to not share tracks with any other \\'L\\' train services.\\nBefore the adoption of color-coded names, the Blue Line was referred to as the West-Northwest Route (which it is still sometimes referred to as today) or more commonly, the O\\'Hare-Congress-Douglas route for its three branches. The Congress and Douglas branches were renamed for their respective terminals, Forest Park and 54th/Cermak, when the current color naming system was adopted in 1993. As of April 25, 2008, the Blue Line no longer operates on the Douglas Branch; it has been officially replaced with the new Pink Line.\\n\\n\\n== Route ==\\n\\n\\n=== O\\'Hare Branch ===\\n\\nThe O\\'Hare Branch is the longest section of the Blue Line (14.6 miles (23.5 km)) and comprises both the oldest and newest segments of the entire route. The line starts at O\\'Hare International Airport in an underground station below the main parking garage. The line emerges in the median of the O\\'Hare main access road (Interstate 190) just northwest of Terminal 5, about a mile (1.6 km) west of Mannheim Road. The line follows Interstate 190 east through Rosemont then tunnels beneath the Kennedy Expressway/Northwest Tollway interchange near the Des Plaines River and continues in the median of the Kennedy Expressway (Interstate 90) east and southeast towards the city until descending back underground southeast Addison Street. The line travels under Kimball Avenue and Milwaukee Avenues through Logan Square. The line then rises above ground onto an elevated route parallel to Milwaukee Avenue (built in 1895 as part of the Metropolitan Elevated).\\n\\n\\n=== Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway ===\\n\\nAt the intersection of Ashland and Milwaukee Avenues, the Blue Line descends into Chicago\\'s second subway route, continuing southeast under Milwaukee Avenue (with stops at Division, Chicago, and Grand), east under Lake Street (crossing beneath the Chicago River) (with a stop at Clark/Lake) south under Dearborn Street (through the central business district) (with stops at Washington, Monroe, and Jackson) and west under Congress Parkway (and a second river crossing) (with stops at LaSalle and Clinton). The tracks emerge from a portal near Halsted Street in the median of the Eisenhower Expressway (Interstate 290) and continue west.\\nA downtown superstation has been proposed to provide express service from the Loop to both O\\'Hare and Midway Airports, via the Blue and Orange Lines respectively. The station would provide services such as baggage check. However, budget issues plague the operation and have prevented construction.\\n\\n\\n=== Congress Branch ===\\n\\nAfter exiting the subway, the tracks continue west in the median of the Eisenhower Expressway as the Congress Branch. Immediately west of the Racine station, the Congress tracks diverge to permit a ramp up to the Douglas Branch elevated structure. This ramp, which is now non-revenue trackage, connects the Douglas branch to the Blue Line. The Congress Branch remains in the median of the expressway through the west side of Chicago until it reaches a portal at Lotus. At this point the tracks tunnel beneath the eastbound expressway lanes and before emerging on the south side of the expressway next to the Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad (CSX) tracks. The route passes through Oak Park and into Forest Park. In the vicinity of Desplaines Avenue the tracks rise and make an S-curve north over the expressway before terminating at a station on the west side of Desplaines Avenue.\\n\\n\\n=== Douglas Branch (former) ===\\n\\nThe Douglas Branch begins at 54th Avenue and Cermak Road in Cicero (5400 W. - 2200 S.). The line runs east on street level right-of-way just north of and parallel to Cermak Road from the terminal to about a quarter-mile (400 m) east of Cicero Avenue, then diagonals northeast until it reaches a corridor parallel and adjacent to 21st Street at Kostner Avenue. It then continues east between 21st Street and Cullerton Street, climbing up from surface level to elevated structure, through the North Lawndale, Little Village, and Pilsen neighborhoods of Chicago, with stops at Kostner, Pulaski, Central Park, Kedzie, California, Western and Damen. The line turns north near Paulina Street stopping at 18th and Polk Streets then curves east over the Eisenhower Expressway (Interstate 290). The Douglas tracks ramps down to the surface of the median of the expressway and joins the Congress (Forest Park) Branch just before the Racine station. On April 28, 2008, the CTA eliminated Blue Line service on the Douglas branch, having been replaced by the Pink Line.\\n\\n\\n== Operating fleet ==\\nCurrently, the Blue Line is operated with the Budd-built 2600-series rail cars. Trains run in eight-car trains on weekdays and four-car trains on weekends although train lengths may be extended to eight cars as necessary for special events and holidays.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe most vintage components of the Blue Line began as part of the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad in 1895. The first section to be built by the Met extended west in the vicinity of Van Buren Street from an independent terminal at Canal and Jackson Streets to Marshfield Avenue, and then northward in the vicinity of Paulina Street to Damen and Milwaukee Avenues. Service on this section began on May 6, 1895. The structure was completed from Damen Avenue to Logan Square on May 25, 1895.\\nThe next stage in the development of the West Side \\'L\\' came on June 19, 1895, when the Garfield Park Branch was added, extending west in the vicinity of Van Buren Street and Harrison Street from Marshfield Avenue to Cicero Avenue. An extension of service over the tracks of the Aurora, Elgin and Chicago Railroad to a new terminal at Desplaines Avenue was established on March 11, 1905. A subsequent extension to Westchester opened on October 1, 1926. (Service on the Westchester extension was discontinued by the CTA on December 9, 1951.)\\nAnother branch line was added to the rapidly growing Metropolitan System on July 29, 1895, when trains began operating over the Humboldt Park Branch, paralleling North Avenue from Damen Avenue to a terminal at Lawndale Avenue. (The route was discontinued on May 3, 1952.) This was followed by still another addition when the Douglas Park Branch was placed in operation as far south as 18th Street on April 28, 1896.\\nAs the southwest area of the city developed, the Douglas Park Branch was extended from 18th Street to Western Avenue in September 1896; to Pulaski Road in June, 1902; to Cicero Avenue in December 1907; to Central Avenue in August, 1912; to 62nd Avenue in August, 1915, and to Oak Park Avenue in Berwyn on March 16, 1924. The present west terminal of the Douglas Branch is 54th Avenue in Cicero, Illinois.\\nThe Metropolitan West Side Elevated began service around the Union Loop on October 11, 1897, and a rush period stub terminal at Wells Street was added October 3, 1904. For much of the early 20th century and through the 1940s, service on the West Side Elevated lines went unchanged until the Chicago Transit Authority took control of Chicago\\'s Rapid Transit System on October 1, 1947, initiating a series of massive service cuts and station closings (that would last until the 1980s).\\nOn February 25, 1951, the CTA opened the Milwaukee-Dearborn subway, connecting the Milwaukee Avenue elevated route (formerly Logan Square) with the Loop on a fast, efficient and more direct routing through the heart of the city. With opening of the Dearborn Subway, the old elevated alignment between Evergreen and Marshfield Avenues was therefore closed and used only for moving out-of-service rail cars. The north section of this connection between Evergreen Avenue and Lake Street was subsequently demolished in 1960s, leaving the Lake Street Branch-to-Douglas Branch section or the \"Paulina Connector\" still in existence.\\nThe Garfield Park elevated was replaced by the Congress route on June 22, 1958, pioneering the world\\'s first use of rail rapid transit and a multi-lane automobile expressway in the same grade-separated right-of-way. (Pacific Electric Railway \"Red Car\" tracks ran in the median of the Cahuenga Parkway in Los Angeles from 1944 until its expansion into the Hollywood Freeway in 1952, but the Pacific Electric service was an interurban streetcar rather than true rapid transit.) The new line connected with the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway at the Chicago River and extended westward to Des Plaines Avenue, Forest Park. An incline connection en route permitted Douglas trains to operate through the subway as well combining the Logan Square, Garfield Park (now Congress), and Douglas routes into the second through service in Chicago, the West-Northwest route.\\nA five-mile (8 km) extension of the route via the short subway connection and the Kennedy Expressway median between Logan Square and Jefferson Park opened on February 1, 1970. It was also built by the City of Chicago using federal money. From Logan Square, trains veer off of the old elevated structure and enter the subway under Milwaukee and Kedzie Avenues to a portal just south of Addison Street, then continue northwest in the median of the Kennedy Expressway to the temporary terminal at Jefferson Park. In March 1980, construction began on the O\\'Hare Airport extension of the Kennedy route between Jefferson Park and the airport. The first section between Jefferson Park and Rosemont was placed in service on February 27, 1983, and the final section to O\\'Hare International Airport on September 3, 1984.\\nOn February 21, 1993, the Chicago Transit Authority adopted a color-coded naming system to the rapid transit system, and the West-Northwest route (OHare-Congress/Douglas) became the Blue Line. On April 26, 1998, the Douglas Branch lost its overnight (owl) and weekend service and began operating between 4 a.m. and 1 a.m. on weekdays only as a result of funding shortages requiring CTA to cut services. Congress (Forest Park) service was effectively doubled through much of the day since service frequency from O\\'Hare required shorter headways than what would have been left.\\nOne reason for the Douglas Branch reduction in service was due to its low ridership, badly deteriorated stations and tracks, and funding problems, while many residents in the communities it runs through had claimed that it was just another attempt by the CTA to eliminate transit service on the West Side.\\nOn September 10, 2001, the CTA began a historic reconstruction of the Douglas Branch to repair its aging stations and tracks. The work was officially completed on January 8, 2005 with new elevated structures, tracks, stations, new communication networks and an upgraded power system along the route. On January 1, 2005, weekend service was restored.\\n\\n\\n== Accidents and incidents ==\\nOn July 11, 2006, a derailment caused a smokey fire in the Blue Line\\'s Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway. There were injuries from smoke inhalation, but no fatalities. The comparatively minor incident prompted heavy news coverage and a temporary stoppage of Chicago subway service because it occurred hours after train bombings in Mumbai earlier the same day.\\nOn September 30, 2013, two Blue Line trains collided at Harlem (Congress Branch), injuring 33 people, after an outbound train was hit by an out-of-service train going the opposite direction on the same track. It was unknown why the out-of-service train was on that track at the time of the crash. There were no passengers on the out-of-service train; the number of workers on it at the time of the crash was also an unknown. Also unknown was the total number of passengers on the outbound, in-service train. The investigation started shortly thereafter. Though service soon went back to normal, trains did not stop at the Harlem station until the late evening on Tuesday, October 1 to avoid interference with the scene and congestion.\\nIn the early morning of March 24, 2014, a Blue Line train derailed at O\\'Hare at the end of its run. Initial reports said that 32 passengers on the train were injured, but none of the injuries were considered life-threatening.  The station reopened on Sunday, March 30, 2014 at 2:00 p.m.\\n\\n\\n== Expansion ==\\n\\n\\n=== Line extensions ===\\nFor the past twenty years, there had been talk of extending the O\\'Hare branch of the Blue Line westward to Schaumburg, but this has recently been changed with the recent developments involving the planning of the Metra STAR Line and various other transportation projects.\\nHowever, in 2008, the Regional Transit Authority revealed a plan to possibly expand commuter rail and bus service to the RTA board, which included a 13.3 miles (21.4 km) extension of the Blue Line on an east-west route from its current western terminus at Forest Park to as far west as the Yorktown shopping center in DuPage County. Several feeder bus routes would also be implemented along the route in order to supplement ridership and increase usefulness. The prospect of this extension was also listed in the Chicago region\\'s 2030 long-term master plan.\\nIn early 2013, the idea of an infill station at Nagle and Bryn Mawr Avenues was declined. For now such a station is strictly an idea but it may come to existence in the future since that particular stretch of the O\\'Hare Branch between Jefferson Park and Harlem is the longest on the \\'L\\' system without a station.\\n\\n\\n=== Extra tracks ===\\n\\nThe surface right-of-way for the Congress Branch, including overcrossings, undergrade bridges, and two short tunnels under the expressway, contains space for one extra track between Forest Park and Kenton Avenue, and two extra tracks from Kenton to the tunnel portals at UIC-Halsted. It was intended that the interurban Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad, which had utilized the Garfield Park Elevated until 1953 to reach its Loop terminal at Wells Street, would use these extra tracks. However, the CA&E ceased passenger service abruptly on July 3, 1957, never to resume, before track construction had started. The CTA also considered plans of its own to add these as express tracks (and service) over the years, as well as a rerouting of the Lake Elevated onto the Paulina Elevated (today\\'s Pink Line) into a new quadrant of the junction with the Douglas Line at Racine, but these plans also never came to fruition.\\n\\n\\n=== Stub tunnels ===\\nThe dual portals of the Congress Branch at UIC-Halsted are actually quadruple; two extra portals also exist to the north of the Blue Line portals, which extend only a few hundred feet beyond the portals, These were intended to accommodate future expansion, including a new CA&E line to a new terminal, or for a variety of later CTA new line proposals which were never realized. Among those plans were a loop subway system via Congress, Dearborn, Lake, and Clinton when the Milwaukee-Dearborn-Congress Subway was completed between 1951\\u201358; a shuttle subway route under Jackson Street to Grant Park (1958 New Horizons for Chicago Metropolitan Area, CTA); and more recently between 1968-78 in the form the Distributor Subway system which was to be routed from UIC-Halsted Station through the north portals, then north under Desplaines Street to Monroe Street, and east under Monroe Street to Grant and Millennium Park where it was to split into two branches: one north to Walton Street serving the North Michigan Avenue area and the other southeast to McCormick Place utilizing Metra Electric right-of-way. Though these portals are still not used, the Monroe Street Distributor Subway was never \"officially\" cancelled when the Crosstown and Loop Subway projects were deferred in 1979. It remains to this day an active program.\\nBetween Grand/Milwaukee and Clark/Lake in the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway, two more stub tunnels also exist, continuing straight while the current Blue Line heads in the northwest direction. This flying junction (actually a stacked flying junction), built in the 1940s along with the initial subway, was intended for a never-built connection to, or subway replacement of, the Lake Street Elevated. In the late 1960s through the mid-1970s, they were also proposed to be a service link between the Dearborn Subway and a high-speed subway route in Randolph Street to replace a portion of the Lake Street \\'L\\' east of Damen Avenue (Transit Planning Study Chicago Central Area, April 1968).\\n\\n\\n== Points of interest ==\\n\\nThe Blue Line serves as a vital link to various airline destinations from the O\\'Hare International Airport (O\\'Hare), Rosemont Convention Center and Allstate Arena (Rosemont), the Gateway Theatre, James R. Thompson Center (Clark/Lake), City Hall-Cook County Building and the Richard J. Daley Center (Washington), Bank One Plaza (Monroe), the Federal Center Buildings (Jackson), La Salle Street Metra Station (La Salle), Amtrak and Metra Union Station, Main Post Office and Greyhound Lines station (Clinton), University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC-Halsted and Racine), UIC Pavilion (Racine) Cook County Hospital, Malcolm X College and the United Center (Illinois Medical District), Oak Park (Austin and Oak Park), and Forest Park (Harlem and Forest Park) among others and several outlying Metra train stations (Jefferson Park, and Irving Park).\\n\\n\\n== Station listing ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nBlue Line at Chicago-L.org', u'1897 New York Giants season': u'\\n== Regular season ==\\n\\n\\n=== Season standings ===\\n\\n\\n=== Roster ===\\n\\n\\n== Player stats ==\\n\\n\\n=== Batting ===\\n\\n\\n==== Starters by position ====\\nNote: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\\n\\n\\n==== Other batters ====\\nNote: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\\n\\n\\n=== Pitching ===\\n\\n\\n==== Starting pitchers ====\\nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\\n\\n\\n==== Other pitchers ====\\nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n1897 New York Giants season at Baseball Reference', u'St. Albans, Queens': u'St. Albans is a middle class community in the New York City borough of Queens centered around the intersection of Linden Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard, about two miles north of JFK Airport. It is southeast of Jamaica, west of Cambria Heights, north of Springfield Gardens, and northwest of Laurelton. The neighborhood is part of Queens Community Board 12, and is served by the St. Albans Post Office, ZIP Code 11412. The population within the ZIP code, according to the 2010 census, was 34,882 \\u2013 a decline of 7% from the 37,452 of 2000.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nPart of a land grant to Dutch settlers from New Netherland Governor Peter Stuyvesant in 1655, the area, like much of Queens, remained farmland and forest for most of the next two centuries.\\nBy the 1800s, the lands of four families \\u2014 the Remsens, Everitts, Ludlums and Hendricksons \\u2014 formed the nucleus of this sprawling farm community in the eastern portion of the Town of Jamaica. In 1814, when the Village of Jamaica (the first village on Long Island) was incorporated, its (the village\\'s) boundaries extended eastward to Freeman\\'s Path (now Farmers Boulevard), and south to Lazy Lane (called Central Avenue in 1900, then Foch Boulevard in the 1920s, and now Linden Boulevard), thus including parts of present-day St. Albans. In 1852, the old mill pond that is now at the center of Baisley Pond Park was acquired by the Brooklyn waterworks for use as a reservoir.\\nIn 1872, the Long Island Rail Road\\'a Cedarhurst Cut-off was built through the area, but no stop appears on the first timetables. In 1892, an area called Francis Farm was surveyed and developed for housing. There were numerous Francis families farming in the eastern portion of the Town of Jamaica in the 1880s. Francis Lewis Boulevard (named for a signer of the Declaration of Independence, from Queens), which does not yet appear on maps from 1909, nor in 1910, is now the eastern boundary of St. Albans.\\nSoon, the first street lights illuminated the crossroads that is now Linden Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard. New shops clustered around August Everitt\\'s lone store. By July 1, 1898, the St. Albans Long Island Rail Road station opened where the tracks crossed Locust Avenue (now Baisley Boulevard). The station was razed and replaced with the current, grade separated station on October 15, 1935.\\nIn 1899, a year after Queens became part of New York City (and with the Town of Jamaica and the Village of Jamaica thereby dissolved), the new post office for the 600 residents was named St. Albans, after St Albans in Hertfordshire, England, which itself was named after a Saint Alban, thought to be the first Christian martyred in England. The name had been in use for the area since at least 1894 for the name of the school district, and the LIRR station was named St. Albans when it opened in 1898. A 1909 map also shows a St Albans Avenue and a St Albans Place in the area.\\nThe St. Albans Golf Course, built in 1915, brought rich and famous golfers, including baseball star Babe Ruth. The Depression forced the golf course owners to try to sell, but plans for private development fell through. The land was seized by the federal government in 1942, and construction soon began on the St. Albans Naval Hospital, which opened in 1943. After construction was completed in 1950, the hospital had 3000 beds and contained a network of 76 wards. The hospital was turned over to the Veterans Administration in 1974 and more recently evolved into the Veterans Administration St. Albans Primary and Extended Care Facility.\\n\\n\\n== Demographic makeup ==\\nMany famous jazz musicians used to live in St. Albans, particularly in some of the large houses in the small western enclave known as Addisleigh Park. The soul musician James Brown lived in St. Albans very near to the Veterans Administration facility. As a neighborhood adjacent to Hollis, St. Albans was one of the birthplaces of the \"Hip Hop\" and Rap music genres in the 1970s and 1980s.\\nSt. Albans housing consists mostly of detached, one and two-family homes. Linden Boulevard is the major shopping street.\\nThe neighborhood and the surrounding areas are considered the heart of Queens\\' working class Black community, with 34% claiming Caribbean ancestry.

Opened in 1932, it was the first line of the Independent Subway System (IND), and the Eighth Avenue Subway name was also applied by New Yorkers to the entire IND system. Most of the line has four tracks, with one local and one express track in each direction, except for the extreme north and south ends, where only the two express tracks continue. The line is signaled as Line \"A\", with tracks A1, A3, A4, and A2 from west to east, running from approximately 800 at the south end to 1540 at the north end (measured in feet).\\nThe line runs from 207th Street in Inwood south to an interlocking south of High Street in Brooklyn Heights, including large sections under St. Nicholas Avenue, Central Park West, and Eighth Avenue. The entire length is underground, though the 207th Street Yard, which branches off near the north end, is on the surface. Flying junctions are provided with the IND Concourse Line, IND Sixth Avenue Line, and IND Queens Boulevard Line.\\nThe whole line is served at all times by the A train, which runs express except during late nights. The C provides local service south of 168th Street while the A runs express. In addition, the B provides weekday local service and the D full-time express service between the Concourse Line (145th Street) and Sixth Avenue Line (59th Street \\u2013 Columbus Circle) junctions, and the E runs local from the Queens Boulevard Line junction at 50th Street south to World Trade Center. The A, C, and E are colored vivid blue on signs while the B and D are bright orange since they use the Sixth Avenue Line through Midtown Manhattan.\\n\\n\\n== Extent and service ==\\nThe following services use part or all of the Eighth Avenue Line. The trunk line\\'s bullets are colored vivid blue:\\nThe Eighth Avenue begins as a two-track subway under Broadway at 207th Street in Inwood. A flying junction just to the south brings two tracks from the 207th Street Yard between the main tracks, merging after Dyckman Street. The subway leaves Broadway to pass under Fort Tryon Park to the north end of Fort Washington Avenue, which it follows to roughly 175th Street before turning southeast under private property.\\nThe small 174th Street Yard lies under Broadway, with two tracks exiting to the south under that roadway. When the George Washington Bridge was designed in the 1920s, provisions were made for a lower deck that would carry these two tracks north from the yard and across the bridge, as well as two commuter rail tracks. However, when the lower level was added in 1962, it instead carried a roadway.\\nThe two main tracks from Fort Washington Avenue enter Broadway near 171st Street, running underneath the yard tracks in a double-decker tunnel. A few blocks later, the lower tracks separate to straddle the yard tracks at 168th Street. The local/express split begins here, with the local tracks coming from the yard and the express tracks coming from Inwood. Contrary to standard practice, the two local tracks are in the center and the two express tracks are on the outside. Except during late nights, the local service (C) ends at 168th Street, reversing direction on the yard tracks; the A runs to 207th Street at all times, express except during late nights. South of 168th Street, the express (outer) tracks lower below the local tracks, forming another double-decker tunnel, this time under St. Nicholas Avenue.\\nNorth of 145th Street, the lower (express) tracks rise into the center, and the three-track IND Concourse Line enters St. Nicholas Avenue below the four-track Eighth Avenue Line. 145th Street is a two-level transfer station, with two island platforms on each level. To the south, the Concourse Line tracks rise and merge with the Eighth Avenue Line, carrying the B onto the local tracks and the D onto the express tracks. The resulting four-track line continues south under St. Nicholas Avenue and Eighth Avenue (Frederick Douglass Boulevard), which becomes Central Park West at 110th Street.\\n\\nMost of the line under Central Park West is built on two levels with both local tracks to the west and only local stations. The two northbound tracks are above the two southbound tracks. Approaching 59th Street \\u2013 Columbus Circle, where Central Park West becomes Eighth Avenue, the subway again spreads out into a single four-track level.\\nA flying junction south of 59th Street takes B and D trains east under 53rd Street, merging with two tracks from 57th Street to become the four-track IND Sixth Avenue Line. The two-track IND Queens Boulevard Line, also in 53rd Street, curves south into a lower level of the 50th Street station, and merges to the south, taking E trains onto the local tracks. An unused southbound-only lower level at 42nd Street \\u2013 Port Authority Bus Terminal was formerly accessed only from the southbound track from the Queens Boulevard Line. Plans for the 7 Subway Extension include partially demolishing the lower level to make room for the new IRT Flushing Line tracks.\\nThe four-track line continues south under Eighth Avenue to 14th Street, where it turns southeast under Greenwich Avenue and south under Sixth Avenue, above the four-track IND Sixth Avenue Line. The two-level West Fourth Street \\u2013 Washington Square station allows easy transfers between the two lines. Just to the south are track connections between the local tracks of each line, not used by current normal service patterns. The Sixth Avenue Line turns east into Houston Street after passing the connections.\\nCanal Street, under Sixth Avenue, is the last normal four-track station on the line. Crossovers in each direction, beyond the station, take C and late night A trains between the local tracks to the north and the express tracks to the south. As the subway turns from Sixth Avenue into Church Street, the southbound local track passes under the express tracks, bringing E trains to the east. At this point, a bellmouth originally intended for the never-built IND Worth Street Line is present on the east side of the tunnel. It has been proposed to use this to bring Long Island Rail Road Atlantic Branch trains to Lower Manhattan as part of the Lower Manhattan-Jamaica/JFK Transportation Project.\\nThe four tracks continue south under Church Street, with two separate but connected stations at World Trade Center at the end of the local tracks and Chambers Street on the express tracks. The two express tracks turn east under Fulton Street, crossing the East River through the Cranberry Street Tunnel into Cranberry Street in Brooklyn. Cranberry Street leads to High Street, from which the line turns south into Jay Street, straddled by the two-track IND Sixth Avenue Line from the Rutgers Street Tunnel. The Eighth and Sixth Avenue Lines end, becoming the IND Fulton Street Line and IND Culver Line, at crossovers (currently unused) allowing trains to switch between the two, south of High Street. Both the A and C trains continue along the Fulton Street Line.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nAs early as March 1918, soon after the BMT Broadway Line opened to Times Square \\u2013 42nd Street, plans were being considered for an extension beyond the stubs at 57th Street (which was not yet open) to the Upper West Side and Washington Heights via Central Park West (Eighth Avenue). On August 3, 1923, the New York City Board of Estimate approved the Washington Heights Line, an extension of the Broadway Line to Washington Heights. The line was to have four tracks from Central Park West at 64th Street under Central Park West, Eighth Avenue, Saint Nicholas Avenue, and private property to 173rd Street, and two tracks under Fort Washington Avenue to 193rd Street. South of 64th Street, one two-track line would connect to the Broadway Line stubs at 57th Street, and another would continue under Eighth Avenue to 30th Street at Penn Station, with provisions to continue downtown.\\nMayor John Hylan instead wanted to build an independent subway system, operated by the city. The New York City Board of Transportation gave preliminary approval to several lines in Manhattan, including one on Eighth Avenue, on December 9, 1924. The main portion of the already-approved Washington Heights Line - the mostly-four track line north of 64th Street - was included, but was to continue north from 193rd Street to 207th Street. South of 64th Street, the plan called for four tracks in Eighth Avenue, Greenwich Avenue, the planned extension of Sixth Avenue, and Church Street. Two tracks would turn east under Fulton Street or Wall Street and under the East River to Downtown Brooklyn.\\nA groundbreaking ceremony was held at St. Nicholas Avenue and 123rd Street on March 14, 1925. The majority of the Eighth Avenue Line, from Chambers Street north to 207th Street, was opened to the public just after midnight on September 10, 1932 after three days of operation on a normal schedule but without passengers. The Cranberry Street Tunnel, extending the express tracks east under Fulton Street to Jay Street \\u2013 Borough Hall in Brooklyn, was opened for the morning rush hour on February 1, 1933. The Jay\\u2013Smith\\u2013Ninth Street Line opened on March 20, 1933, extending the line beyond Jay Street \\u2013 Borough Hall.\\nWhen the subway opened in 1932, express (A) and local (AA) trains served the line; expresses did not run during late nights or Sundays. Expresses and late night/Sunday locals were sent south into Brooklyn in February 1933, and, when the IND Concourse Line opened on July 1, 1933, the C was added to the express service, while all locals became CC trains to the Concourse Line, forcing A trains to run local north of 145th Street. The E was added to the local tracks south of 50th Street on August 19, 1933, when the IND Queens Boulevard Line opened. The final major change came on December 15, 1940, when the IND Sixth Avenue Line opened. The AA was brought back as a non-rush hour local service, becoming the BB and switching to the Sixth Avenue Line at 59th Street \\u2013 Columbus Circle during rush hours. The CC was kept only during rush hours to provide local service south past 59th Street. Additionally the C became a rush hour-only service, replaced by a full-time D over the express tracks between the Concourse and Sixth Avenue Lines. This created the pattern that has remained to this day, with five services during normal hours: the A express, B part-time local via Sixth Avenue (then BB), C local (then AA and CC), D express via Sixth Avenue, and E local from Queens.\\nA report for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation looking at the Lower Manhattan Rail Link, an idea to connect Lower Manhattan with the Long Island Rail Road and JFK International Airport, presented several alternatives that would utilize the Cranberry Street Tunnel instead of building a new East River Tunnel. These alternatives would require that C trains be rerouted through the Rutgers Street Tunnel.\\n\\n\\n=== IND Worth Street Line ===\\nThe IND Worth Street Line was a proposed major expansion of the IND Eighth Avenue Line. It was to come out of the main line\\'s local tracks along Sixth Avenue/Church Street south of Canal Street and turn south-east into Worth Street. This route would travel in a two-track tunnel and probably stop at Foley Square (Lafayette and Centre Streets, on the north side of Federal Plaza), Chatham Square (with a possible connection to the Second Avenue Subway), Rutgers Street\\u2013East Broadway (with a connection to the IND Rutgers Street Line), and a station in the Lower East Side (possibly Pitt Street and Grand Street).\\nCrossing to Williamsburg, the line was to have stops at Havemeyer Street, South Fourth Street (connections to the IND Crosstown Line and a major junction to the IND Houston Street Line, the IND Utica Ave Line and a connection to the Rockaways). The Manhattan portion from the Church Street bellmouth to the East River would have been about two miles long.\\nAlthough the line never saw construction, evidence remains visible of a plan to build it. Vestiges of a bell-mouth can be seen while traveling on the local tracks south of Canal Street. A large open space above the platform level at East Broadway was intended to become a two-track station. Above the north end of the Broadway station, a six-track station where the IND Worth Street and the Houston Street Lines would have converged can be envisioned.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\n== Station listing ==\\n*50th Street is accessible only in the southbound direction.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nThe line and track descriptions use information in track maps on nycsubway.org, later published in Dougherty, Peter (2002).

It is also used to refer to the high-technology industry that developed from the 1960s to the 1980s in the suburban areas along the highway.\\nThe majority of the highway is built to freeway standards, and about 3/5 of it is part of the Interstate Highway System (that stretch has the dual designation 128/Interstate 95).\\nIn local culture, Route 128 is seen as something of a dividing line between the inner municipalities of Greater Boston and the more far-flung suburbs. The road\\'s roughly 10-mile (16 km) radius, for example, also delimits most of the area accessible by the MBTA rapid transit system. Much of the area within Route 128 was developed before World War II, while the area outside it was developed more recently.\\nDespite a majority of Route 128\\'s length running concurrent with either I-93 or I-95, many area residents refer to the entire length of the highway as Route 128. This includes the portion of I-93 south of Canton, which is no longer 128 at all, and substantial portions of I-95 that are not noticeably signed as 128. The perception of Route 128 running the entire length of highway from Gloucester to Braintree dates back to the road\\'s pre-Interstate era, and has become an established part of local culture.\\n\\n\\n== Route description ==\\nThe route 128 number dates from the origin of the Massachusetts highway system in the 1920s. By the 1950s, it ran from Nantasket Beach in Hull to Gloucester. The first, 27-mile (43 km), section of the current limited-access highway from Braintree to Gloucester was opened in 1951. It was the first limited-access circumferential highway in the United States.\\n\\nRoute 128 runs concurrently with Interstate 95 from Canton north to Peabody and, when I-95 continues north from Peabody toward New Hampshire, east from Peabody to Gloucester. Until the early 1990s, it also ran concurrently with the present Interstate 93 from Canton to Braintree. This stretch of Interstate 93, which is now also designated as part of U.S. Route 1, though no longer officially part of Route 128, is still often referred to as \"Route 128\" by locals. The I-95 and I-93 signage were added in the mid-1970s when plans to construct I-95 through Boston, directly connecting the two I-95/Route 128 interchanges, were cancelled. An unused cloverleaf in Canton, now removed, was the one leftover structure from this plan.\\nUntil 1965, while and shortly after the Route 3 freeway to Cape Cod was fully finished, the section of current Route 3 between exits 15 and 20 was also designated as Route 128. The route\\'s southern end was then truncated to its intersection with Route 3 in Braintree. The non-freeway section of Route 128 from Route 3 through Hingham to Nantasket was redesignated Route 228. The Massachusetts Highway Department has tried twice, in 1997 and 2003, to truncate 128 even further, back to its intersection with I-95 in Peabody, but local opposition has convinced them to back down. A reflection of these attempts are along every interchange, where the main signage on the intersecting route indicates the highway as I-95, while smaller signage to the sides also identifies the road as Route 128.\\n\\nThe area along the western part of Route 128 is home to a number of high-technology firms and corporations. This part of Route 128 has been dubbed and even signed as \"America\\'s Technology Highway\", and through to the end of the 1980s, was second only to Silicon Valley. Roughly 6 months later, those blue signs were later changed to \"America\\'s Technology Region\" due to complaints received from MA\\'s National Guard\\'s Yankee Division, the Yankee Division Association, after whom the highway was officially named circa 1948.\\nRoute 128 makes more than a 180-degree arc around Boston, and clockwise is \"north\" even when the road heads slightly south of east when approaching the Atlantic Ocean. Hackers in the area refer to this as going \"logical north\" on the route. Interstate 93, going north-and-south, intersects Route 128, which nominally goes north-and-south, at a right angle, about 15 miles (24 km) north of Boston. A traveller going \"logical south\" on 128 (compass west) from the I-93 interchange will soon find himself driving due west, travelling logically south on 128 and I-95, and north on US 3 in a wrong-way concurrency.\\nLike the I-95 signage mapping onto 128, the mapping of US 3 onto this stretch of 128 is due to US 3 as a separate limited access highway terminating in Burlington on 128 instead of further south at Route 2 in Lexington as originally envisioned. This abrupt termination requires the US 3 signage to continue along 128 for somewhat over a mile until it can interchange the old US 3 surface arterial. Moreover, when I-93 and Route 128 ran concurrently south of Boston, before the route was truncated to the I-95 interchange in Canton, they were signed in opposite directions, so it was possible to travel north on I-93 and south on Route 128 at the same time.\\nMuch of Route 128 is now part of the Interstate system, being concurrent with I-95 (and formerly I-93). However, the vast majority of locals will refer to these stretches as 128; it is uncommon for a local to use the Interstate designation(s) in ordinary conversation or while giving directions.\\n\\nThe northernmost several exits along Route 128, past exit 12, are not grade-separated interchanges. Exit 10 is signed as the signalized intersection with Route 127, and there are two rotaries between that and exit 12 (the Crafts Road interchange).\\nFollowing the completion of the Peabody I-95/Route 128 interchange (Exit 45/29) in 1988; the exit system was changed from concurrency along 128 to a system using the I-95 exits. The exits, which had gone from Gloucester to Braintree, were renumbered along I-95, from the Rhode Island state line to the border with New Hampshire. Exit 37 had been the interchange with I-93, which also had its exit numbered 37 at that interchange. Coincidentally, with the renumbering, exit 37 remained exit 37.\\nRoute 128 Station is located along the highway in Westwood, Massachusetts and is served by Amtrak\\'s Northeast Corridor line and MBTA commuter rail.\\n\\n\\n== The high-tech region ==\\nIn 1955, Business Week ran an article titled \"New England Highway Upsets Old Way of Life\" and referred to Route 128 as \"the Magic Semicircle\". By 1958, it needed to be widened from six to eight lanes, and business growth continued, often driven by technology out of Harvard University and MIT. In 1957, there were 99 companies employing 17,000 workers along 128; in 1965, 574; in 1973, 1,212. In the 1980s, the area was often compared to California\\'s Silicon valley, and the positive effects of this growth on the Massachusetts economy were dubbed the \"Massachusetts Miracle\".\\nMajor companies with significant locations in the broader Route 128 area included:\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Surface roads and south Circumferential Highway ===\\nRoute 128 was assigned by 1927 along local roads, running from Route 138 in Milton around the west side of Boston to Route 107 (Essex Street or Bridge Street) in Salem. Its route was as follows:\\nBy 1928, it had been extended east to Quincy from its south end along the following streets, ending at the intersection of Route 3 and Route 3A (now Route 3A and Route 53):\\nThe first section of the new Circumferential Highway, in no way the freeway that it is now, was the piece from Route 9 in Wellesley around the south side of Boston to Route 3 (now Route 53) in Hingham. Parts of this were built as new roads, but most of it was along existing roads that were improved to handle the traffic. In 1931, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works acquired a right-of-way from Route 138 in Canton through Westwood, Dedham and Needham to Route 9 in Wellesley. This was mostly 80 feet (24 m) wide, only shrinking to 70 feet (21 m) in Needham, in the area of Great Plain Avenue and the Needham Line. Much of this was along new alignment, but about half \\u2014 mostly in Needham \\u2014 was along existing roads:\\nRoyall Street from west of Route 138 to east of Green Street (Canton)\\nGreen Lodge Street from Royall Street (now cut by Route 128) to Route 128 Station (Canton and Westwood)\\nGreendale Avenue from Lyons Street and Common Street just south of the Charles River to Hunting Avenue (Dedham and Needham)\\nFremont Street north from Highland Avenue (Needham)\\nReservoir Street from Central Avenue to Route 9 (Needham and Wellesley)\\nFrom Route 138 in Canton east through the Blue Hills Reservation in Canton, Milton, Quincy and Braintree, Norfolk County acquired a right-of-way in 1927 and built the Blue Hill River Road. This tied into West Street in northwest Braintree, which itself had been taken over by the county in 1923.\\nWest Street led to Route 37, which ran southeast to Braintree center. This part of Route 37 had been taken over by the state in 1919 (to Braintree center) and 1917 (in Braintree center).\\nThe rest of the new highway, from Route 37 east to Route 3 (now Route 53), through Braintree, Weymouth and Hingham, was taken over by the state in 1929. This was all along existing roads, except possibly the part of Park Avenue west of Route 18 in Weymouth.\\nBy 1933, the whole Circumferential Highway had been completed, and, except for the piece from Route 9 in Wellesley south to Highland Avenue in Needham, was designated as Route 128. Former Route 128 along Highland Avenue into Needham center was left unnumbered (as was the Circumferential Highway north of Highland Avenue), but the rest of former Route 128, from Needham center east to Quincy, became part of Route 135. Thus the full route of the Circumferential Highway, as it existed by 1933, is now the following roads:\\nAt the same time as Route 128 was extended along the new Circumferential Highway, it was extended further into Hull. This alignment, not part of the Circumferential Highway, ran southeast on Route 3 (now Route 53) (Whiting Street) to the border of Hingham and Norwell, where it turned north on present Route 228 (Main Street) through Hingham and into Hull. The exact route through Hingham was Main Street, Short Street, Leavitt Street, East Street, and Hull Street. The end of the numbered route was at the south end of Nantasket Beach, where Nantasket Avenue curves northwest to follow the shore of Massachusetts Bay.\\n\\n\\n=== West and North Circumferential Highway and extension to Gloucester ===\\n\\n\\n=== Route 128/I-95/I-93 Add-A-Lane project ===\\nThe $315 million MassDOT Highway Division project has started widening on the project to upgrade the existing 14.3-mile (23.0 km) six-lane section of highway to eight lanes from north of Route 9 in Wellesley to Route 24 in Randolph. The project consists of adding a lane on the inside of each carriageway, complete with a 10-foot inside shoulder. The existing 1950s bridges, 22 in total, will be replaced as well. The project will be constructed in five phases over a twelve-year period. Construction of phase 1 began in 2004. The first phase of the project consisted of replacing the existing three-lane Route 128 bridges over University Avenue/MBTA/Amtrak and the Neponset River with new four-lane bridges in Canton. The project also included construction of a new two-lane ramp from Route 128 to I-95. The $33 million project was awarded to SPS New England of Salisbury.\\nDuring the initial construction of Route 128, a provision had already been made for a fourth lane within the widely spaced median along the 1.5-mile (2.5 km) length of Route 128 running from just north of the U.S. Route 1 interchange in Dedham, Massachusetts, north-westwards to the Route 109 interchange, and this will finally be used for the Add-A-Lane project.\\nConstruction on phase 1 was officially completed in October 2009. Construction of phase 2 of the project began in summer 2006. This phase of the project consisted of the replacement of the Route 1 and Route 1A bridges over Route 128 in Dedham along with the road widening between Exits 13 and 15 (US 1). Construction of four sound barriers between the US 1 and I-95 interchanges were also included. This phase was completed in the Spring of 2011.\\nConstruction on phase 3, begun in April 2009, is widening I-93/US 1 to 4 lanes in each direction from Route 24 to the I-95 interchange. This phase of the project was expected to be completed by September 2011, however now will not be finished until mid-2012. Phase 4 of the Project, which began in March 2011, is replacing seven bridges and widens Route 128 (I-95) to four lanes in each direction from Route 109 to south of Highland Avenue in Needham. This phase of the project is expected to be completed by June 2015 with an estimated cost of $88 million, the most expensive contract so far. The southeastern freeway that extends from Braintree to Cape Cod, MA Route 3, is also in the process of undergoing a similar \"add-a-lane\" project for much of its own 42 mile length.\\n\\n\\n=== Route 128 Corridor study ===\\nThe Boston area MPO studied the Route 128/I-95 Corridor from approximately 2005\\u20132010. The study focused on the heavily congested section from I-90 (Newton) to US 3 (Burlington), and was completed in November 2010. As of 2010, the highway carried over 200,000 vehicles per day. Some possible improvements to Route 128 include HOV Lanes, reconstruction of shoulders, ramp metering, bus on shoulder, and fiber optic traffic system improvements. More studies will need to be completed before projects will begin.\\n\\n\\n== Signage ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sign upgrade projects on Route 128 ===\\nAs of the end of 2011, the state is between resigning projects on Route 128 that are replacing the 25-year-old signs with new exit, regulatory and route signs. Starting in 1998 and continuing through 2002, signs were replaced through a $1.1 million project between Reading and Lynnfield. Progress continued in 2005 and 2006 during a $2.2 million project which replaced the signs on from Peabody to Gloucester, and continued with a $1.4 million project in 2008 and 2009 that replaced signs in Peabody and the remaining ones in Lynnfield. A $2.9 million federal stimulus project helped replace exit and highway signs in 2010 and 2011 along Route 128 from US-3 in Lexington to I-93 in Reading.\\nA project valued at $4.5 million is expected to begin in the Fall of 2012 that will replace exit & guide signs on Route 128 from Route 9 (Exit 20) in Wellesley to Routes 4/225 (Exit 31) in Lexington. And starting in Summer 2014 a new project is to replace a variety of signs from Highland Avenue in Needham to Route 109 in Dedham. New signage was put up between I-95 and US 1 in 2010 and most of the signage between I-95 and Route 24 has been replaced as of December 2011. New mileage markers were placed every 2/10 of a mile along the highway in 2010 (except for the area covered by the widening project) for I-93 between Braintree and Canton and I-95 from Canton to Peabody. New markers put along Route 128 from Peabody to Gloucester reflect the state highway\\'s total mileage from Canton, indicating MassDOT\\'s change of heart in decommissioning the route where it shares the road with I-95. The previous mile markers (reflected in the exit list below) had mile 0 in Peabody.\\n\\n\\n== Exit list ==\\nExit numbers along the I-95 portion of Route 128 are in accordance to the I-95 exit numbering scheme in Massachusetts. The stretch north of I-95, as well as the rest of the length before I-95 exit numbering was applied, has decreasing exit numbers traveling northbound, contrary to almost all highways in the US with numbered exits.

That land was a rancho called La Rosa de Castilla, on the east side of the Los Angeles River, taking in the deserted hills between Los Angeles and Pasadena. In late 1874 the two men offered an additional thirty-five acres, divided into 65x165-foot lots, for $150 each. They planned the laying out of streets of the present community of East Los Angeles and gifted East Side Park (the present Lincoln Park) to the city of Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n== Population and housing ==\\nIn 2000, a total of 286,222 people lived in the 20.66 square miles of the Eastside region, amounting to 13,852 people per square mile. The neighborhood was \"not especially diverse\" ethnically, with a high percentage of Latino people. The ethnic breakdown was Latino, 91.2%; Asian, 5.2%, white, 2.3%; black, 0.7% and other, 0.6%. Just 5.1% of residents aged 25 and older had a four-year college degree. Almost two-thirds (66.8%) of the inhabitants lived in shared housing, and 33.2% were homeowners.\\n\\n\\n== Communities ==\\nBoyle Heights\\nEast Los Angeles\\nEl Sereno\\nLincoln Heights\\nUniversity Hills\\n\\n\\n== Notable places ==\\nCalifornia State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) - University Hills\\nLatino Walk of Fame - East Los Angeles\\nMariachi Plaza - Boyle Heights\\nEl Mercado de Los Angeles - Boyle Heights\\nCalvary Cemetery (Roman Catholic) - East Los Angeles\\nHome of Peace Cemetery (Jewish) - East Los Angeles\\nEvergreen Cemetery - Boyle Heights\\nChinese Cemetery of Los Angeles - East Los Angeles\\nEstrada Courts Murals - Boyle Heights\\nEl Pino (The Pine Tree) - East Los Angeles\\n\\n\\n== Notable people ==\\n\\n\\n== Contested geography ==\\nThe Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times defines the Eastside as comprising Boyle Heights, El Sereno, Lincoln Heights, and East Los Angeles. However, the boundaries are a matter of perennial discussion and debate amongst the residents of Los Angeles.\\nThe Mapping L.A. definition corresponds to the traditional boundaries, but, beginning in the early 21st century, residents of some of the rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods west of Downtown Los Angeles but on the eastern side of Central Los Angeles, such as Echo Park and Silver Lake, began to refer to their neighborhoods as part of the Eastside. This debate has generated some friction, which, according to Ali Modarres, an expert on the geography of Los Angeles from the University of Washington Tacoma, is to be expected because neighborhood names are \"full of meaning, nuances, history, cultural and political relationships.\" Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles and a fourth generation resident, is a traditionalist, stating that \"true east is east of downtown.\"\\nThe trend led the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council to declare officially in February 2014 that Silver Lake is not part of the Eastside.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nBorn in East L.A., motion picture\\nChicano, ethnic term\\nEast LA Classic, football game\\nBlood In Blood Out, motion picture\\nCity Times in Los Angeles Times suburban sections\\nZoot Suit Riots, 1943\\nTen Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles County\\n8Template:EastLA.com Internet Official website**\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nRomo, Ricardo (1983).
